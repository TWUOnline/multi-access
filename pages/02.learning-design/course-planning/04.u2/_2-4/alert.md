#### Activity 2.4: Writing Learning Outcomes

:fa-book: Read section 12.8 [Step six: set appropriate learning goals](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/11-8-step-six-set-appropriate-learning-goals/) in *Teaching in a Digital Age*.

Consider the question Bates asks:
:fa-question: Take a course you are teaching in class at the moment. Write down the learning goals. Given the need for developing the skills needed in a digital age, would you want to change the goals of this course? If so, would you have to change your teaching methods and/or use of technology?

:fa-question: In addition to the course learning outcomes listed in your syllabus, what are the unit learning outcomes?  If you are planning out a course currently, consider taking the time to map out the lesson with these details in mind.
