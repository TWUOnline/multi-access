## Topic 2: Key Principles of Online Course Design

If you know any Instructional Designers...this section is at the heart of what we do!  What makes a good online course?  A good learning activity?  How do we facilitate learning experiences that allow our students to engage with the topics, grow in their critical thinking skills, and collaborate with others?

In the next few pages we focus on three key principles in online learning (of course there are so many more!).  As you read and engage with the learning activities, consider your own view of learning and teaching, and how this impacts your course design and teaching methods.
