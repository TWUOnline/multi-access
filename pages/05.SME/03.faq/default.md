## FAQ for Course Developers

* **What are the advantages of having the content for a course go through the Design Process?**  
In your daily practice as a teacher of the subject, there are many ways to instruct your students. Creating content fidelity ensures that students from different cohorts receive the same quality of content, learning, and experiences. Designing a course allows you to be the expert on the subject and create the learning environment and plan the application from the beginning. This adds flexibility, quality, and coherence to the course.

* **What are the steps of the Design Process?**  
The key steps in developing an online course at TWU are:
  1. Pre-planning (hiring & contracts)
  2. Planning (completion of a Blueprint)
  3. Writing (units, assessments, guides)
  4. Production (our online team puts your courses online)  
  5. Review (of online course; during/after delivery for quality check)

For more details, see [What to Expect](https://multi-access.twu.ca/sme/expect).

* **Who owns the content I write?**  
As the creator of the work, you own it.  So does TWU.  Most course development contracts state: the Employee hereby grants to the University a perpetual, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, indivisible and non-transferrable license to use the Work for university purposes." This means the university can use the course for its own purposes at any time - including giving the material to another instructor, modifying the course, etc. This includes Moodle material. Please inquire about your specific course because we know that there will be special and unique cases.

At TWU, we want to encourage open access to materials. As you develop your course, please consider using and creating Open Educational Resources that are available to all faculty and learners.


* **How long does the Design Process usually takes?**  
There are many factors that affect the timeline of a course development, however we consider that in average, completing the Design Process can take between 6 to 10 months.

* **What type of support will I get from the Online Learning Team?**  
Our online team is here to guide you through the course development process.  Here are some things we do:
### Instructional Designers:
- Meet with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs - course developers) - typically every two weeks to touch base on writing progress and to discuss questions that arise.
- Share resources that can be used in your online teaching and course development (e.g. OERs, H5P, and more!)
- Suggest ideas for learning activities, consultations about technology, and if you're part of a course development, we can help you at all steps.
- Review all course materials.  More than simply an edit, our Instructional Designers take a deep dive into your course units and assessments.  We look at the following:
  - Is the content engaging, clear, and aligned with course/unit learning outcomes?
  - Is there a need for additional materials (e.g. graphics, videos) to help explain concepts?
  - Are there clear expectations for assignments?  We provide example grading rubrics and instructions to help students and instructors.

### Learning Technologists / Academic Technology Ambassadors  
- If you have any questions about Moodle, WordPress, Email, and so much more, please reach out to our ATAs and learning technologists!  The easiest way is to email elearning@twu.ca or [File a Bug Report](https://github.com/TWUOnline/bug-tracking/issues/new?assignees=cmadland%2C+kmarjanovic%2C+MeeksonHundoo&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=).  The bug report is especially useful to help us track edits for your online course.
- Put your course online.  Whether this is through Moodle, GitHub/Grav, or WordPress, our team can convert your documents to online text.
- Create

### Media Specialists and Graphic Artists
- Produce videos.  This could be filming an interview, class activity, lecture, or field trip experience.  Talk to Jeff & your Instructional Designer to brainstorm ideas.  See our [Videos page](https://multi-access.twu.ca/media/videos) for more details.
- Fine-tune slideshows
- Create graphics, including graphic organizers, infographics, etc.  See our [Graphics page](https://multi-access.twu.ca/media/graphics) for more examples and guidance.
