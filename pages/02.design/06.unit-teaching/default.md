### Setting the Stage

Imagine you're driving to the TWU Langley campus, reviewing in your head the lecture you're about to give your class.  It's on a topic you are stoked about - and you hope your students will understand the concepts and be inspired by the lesson.

You go over your opening: First, a welcome message to students, talk a bit about the previous lesson, perhaps some comments on a recent assignment submission.  And then, you introduce the topic.

How will you hook your learners so they stay motivated and engaged? Start with a story? A metaphor? Bring in a current event?  Play a video clip or song?

When describing what you'll go over in the lecture, what key points will you give them a preview of?  How will you summarize the topics in a way that learners are intrigued and want to know more?

Now, imagine you had to do this online...asynchronously.

### Unit Writing

When we write our units, we first consider our online learners. They may be sitting at a desk, after a long day of work/studies/  They have 2 hours to study tonight.  As they click on "Unit 1"...what do they see and read that will interest them in the topic?  How will they know what the unit is about and what activities they need to complete?

Our units typically follow a structure that allows for students to engage with the lesson, plan their time, and prepare for assignments.

See the details of the course unit template below, as well as [TWU Unit Template - ONLINE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XdNGUPgpYB_IKALdL7cEpwY5NH0z_ywqwxj4G-8rwYY/edit?usp=sharing) Google doc for you to copy.
