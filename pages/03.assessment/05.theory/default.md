# Measurement

Recall that [educational assessment is not a direct measurement](https://multi-access.twu.ca/assessment/theoretical-framework) of a definite quantity of something, but rather it is an inference about what a learner knows, understands, or is able to do based on data gathered from performance tasks. For example, we can directly measure (with variable degrees of specificity) the length of a segment of rope, the mass of a basketball, or the velocity of a train. We cannot directly measure a learner's ability in relation to any given learning outcome. So educational assessment is an inference about a learner's ability, which is a latent construct. Even the most 'objective' of exams, where every item has a definite correct response is not a direct measurement of a latent construct.

This does not mean that all exams are bad or that we should abandon examinations altogether. It does mean that we should express sufficient epistemic humility when considering what we can learn about what learners know. Many will be familiar with the ideas of *validity* and *reliability* in relation to research findings. Since educational assessment is a matter of reasoning based on evidence and thus an example of research, validity and reliability are relevant constructs.

Reliability is a measurement of the *precision* of a given instrument for a given sample of examinees.  Reliability is most often expressed as `coefficient alpha`, or a measure of the instrument's internal consistency. An unreliable test cannot support valid inferences. Validity refers to the evidence presented to support the meaning and interpretation of results from a measurement instrument. Validity does ***NOT*** refer to a quality of an instrument or a score, but rather whether the ***inference is supported by the data***.

Evidence for validity depends on what inferences are being drawn and what assumptions are being made. 

Examples:

| Instrument  | Construct  | Measurement process |
|---|---|---|
| ruler | reading ability | measure foot length and make an inference about reading ability |
| essay | writing ability | count the number of words an examinee writes and make an inference about writing ability |


# Psychometrics

The fundamental equation in classical test theory is  

$$
X = T + E
$$
  
  Where:
- $X$ - observed or raw score
- $T$ - unobserved true score
- $E$ - Error
