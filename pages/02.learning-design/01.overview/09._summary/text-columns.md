### Final Thoughts

In many ways, "building" a course is no different than building a house - one does not simply put a bunch of pieces of wood together and call it a house. Designing an effective course that focuses on student learning is no different - one cannot simply "dump" content onto a page and expect students to learn.

Much like building a house, course design requires intentional thought and sequential, logical planning. First, one must consider ***who*** we are "building" the course for; next, we can begin planning ***how*** we will go about delivering a positive, intuitive learning experience (the Blueprint). As our planning evolves, we can begin to add details that will engage learners and promote learning - the Blueprint will provide a contextual overview of how each component fits together. Once we have a sense of how all the pieces work together, we can add our assessments with a sense of confidence that they align with the rest of the content in our course.

While the course design process is intended to be flexible and fluid, it is also intended to be intentional and purposeful. Laying the groundwork (Blueprint) is a critical component to ensure we have a strong foundation that cultivates an environment of learning.
