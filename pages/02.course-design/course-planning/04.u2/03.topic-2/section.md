## Topic 2: Anatomy of an Online Course

Here is where we get into the nitty-gritty of what a course looks like!  Again, let me repeat that every course is different and may not have these elements.  

In the course planning BLUEPRINT, we outline the topics of the course, the learning outcomes for each topic, the assessments, and the resources. Sometimes we can plan out the formative learning activities, but often we add those throughout the unit writing process.

In this next sections, we'll share what a typical unit looks like.
