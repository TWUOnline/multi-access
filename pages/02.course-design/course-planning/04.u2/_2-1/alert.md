#### Activity 2.1: What's Your Metaphor?

Before we get into more of the design process and models, what's your metaphor for designing a course?  Does it seem like an impromptu marathon that is sprung on you, or a paced cooking experience where you can get creative with your own recipe? How about following the "easy" directions in assembling a child's toy?

Whatever your guiding metaphor is, consider your first steps.  What are the big ideas of your course?  What are the needs of your students?

As we move forward in course planning, select a course you'd like to focus on in these few weeks we have together.  What are your key needs as we map out your course?
