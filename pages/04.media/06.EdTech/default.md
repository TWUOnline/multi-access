# Considerations for Educational Technology

​There is a plethora of tools available to engage students and help meet the learning outcomes of your course. Before deciding which tools to use, ask these questions:
- What are the learning outcomes of the activity/assignment?
- What access do students have?
- Will this tool be a barrier to learning? (e.g. more time spent on tech than learning).
- What support is available for students who use this tool?
- Could students choose their own tool to demonstrate their learning?


In the tabs below are some links to help students and instructors **communicate, collaborate, share, engage and create.**
Also, be sure to check out the tools available through Moodle (e.g. [H5P](https://h5p.org/) is a great one!).

[ui-accordion-item title="Reflect & Share"]

# Reflect & Share
How can educational technology be used to encourage and develop critical thinking skills?  The tools listed below require reflective thinking, selecting content to share, refining ideas, and responding to peers.
- [WordPress](http://create.twu.ca/help/wordpress): Consider having a blog or e-portfolio assignment in your course. Not only will learners develop digital skills, but this online platform allows students to share their learning experience and connect with peers. Note that blogs can be kept private and students should be made aware of privacy concerns.

## Evaluating E-Learning Tools
When selecting an e-learning tool, it is important to evaluate its effectiveness and appropriateness.

The Rubric for E-Learning Tool Evaluation from Anstey and Watson offers educators a framework, with criteria and levels of achievement, to assess the suitability of an e-learning tool for their learners' needs and for their own learning outcomes and classroom context.

The following notes are modified from [A Rubric for Evaluating E-Learning Tools in Higher Education](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2018/9/a-rubric-for-evaluating-e-learning-tools-in-higher-education) by Lauren M. Anstey and Gavan P. L. Watson from Western University.

1. **Functionality:** Does the tool serve its intended purpose well?   
- **Scale:** Is the tool flexible in accommodating various class sizes and groups?  
- **Ease of Use:** Is the tool intuitive and easy to use?  
- **Tech Support / Help Availability:** Is there timely support available?  
- **Hypermediality:** Does the tool support and encourage instructors and students to engage with and communicate through different forms of media in a flexible, nonlinear fashion?  

2. **Accessibility:** Does the tool support the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles of flexible, adaptable curriculum design to support multiple learning approaches and engagement for all students?  
- **User-Focused Participation:** Does the tool address the needs of diverse users and include broader understandings of literacies and student capabilities?  
- **Required Equipment:** Are there environmental factors that impact accessibility, such as necessary hardware (e.g., speakers, a microphone, and a mobile phone) and the technology or service (e.g., high-speed internet connection) that users need to engage with an e-learning tool?  
- **Cost of Use:** What are the financial costs of the tool?  

3. **Technical:** What basic technologies are needed to make the tool work?  
- **Integration/Embedding within a Learning Management System (LMS).** Does the tool "play well" with an institution's LMS? (Moodle)  
- **Desktop/Laptop Operating Systems and Browser:** Can learners effectively use the e-learning tool on a desktop or laptop computer if they have a standard, up-to-date operating system (OS) and/or browser?  
- **Additional Downloads:** Does the tool require learners to install additional software or browser plug-ins?  

4. **Mobile Design:**  
- **Access.** Can students access and interact with the tool either through the download of an application ("app") built for their OS or through the browser?  
- **Functionality.** Are there differences between the mobile version and the desktop version?  
- **Offline Access.** Does the tool offer an offline mode to expand access for those who have limited or intermittent connectivity?  

5. **Privacy, Data Protection, and Rights**  
- **Sign Up / Sign In.** Does the tool ask students to create an account, requiring personal information?  
- **Data Privacy and Ownership.** Does the tool claim ownership of the work that is residing on their
servers, or make their content publicly available by default?   
- **Archiving, Saving, and Exporting Data.** Does the tool help guard against data loss through export and backup while also offering learners the flexibility to freely move their content between tools rather than being locked
into or committed to one tool?  

6. **Social Presence**
The final three categories of the rubric stem from the [Communities of Inquiry (CoI) model](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2018/9/a-rubric-for-evaluating-e-learning-tools-in-higher-education#fn14) which
considers, in part, how the design of online learning environments might best
create and sustain a sense of community among learners.

This category focuses on establishing a safe, trusting environment that fosters
collaboration, teamwork, and an overall sense of community.

- **Collaboration.** Does the tool provide students opportunities to interact with their peers and
collaborate on activities to build a sense of community.
- **User Accountability.** Does the tool provide a safe and trusted
environment?  
- **Diffusion.** Is it a commonly used tools, allowing students to feel comfortable
with and positive about using it, thus contributing to regular use, endorsement,
and sense of belonging.  

7. **Teaching Presence** Does the tool enable instructors to establish and maintain their teaching presence through
facilitation, customization, and feedback?  
- **Facilitation.** Does the tool provide easy-to-use features that enhance
an instructor's ability to effectively engage in facilitation activities?  
- **Customization.** Does the tool allow for flexibility and customization, supporting
instructors in communicating alignment of learning outcomes — making it clear to students why
they are doing what they are doing.  
- **Learning Analytics.** Does the tool assess the availability, quality, and
user-friendliness of the analytics offered to ensure the tool supports the
desired data required for tracking performance, providing feedback on learning,
and informing course design?  

8. **Cognitive Presence** Does the tool support students' cognitive engagement in learning tasks.
- **Enhancement of Cognitive Task(s).** Does the tool enhance or
transform learning by modifying or redefining engagement in the targeted task, either by redesigning the activity
or by establishing new approaches previously inconceivable or unachievable
through other means.   
- **Higher-Order Thinking.** Does the tool help learners integrate, rearrange, or extend new and existing information to achieve a purpose or find answers to a complex problem?  
- **Metacognitive Engagement.** Does the tool prompt understanding, regulation, and reflection of students' own cognitive activities across the learning process?
