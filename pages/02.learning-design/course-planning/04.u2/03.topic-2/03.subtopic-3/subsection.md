## Unit Learning Activities and Assessments

In week two of our course, we will explore learning activities and assessments in detail, but for now, let's talk about one key concept: making connections between learning outcomes, learning activities, and assessments.

Look at the learning outcomes of one of your lessons/units.  How will students demonstrate their learning?  The answer is often through assessment of some kind.  But how do we prepare learners for the assessment?  This is where the **learning activities** come in.
Here are some of the learning activities we've had in this course so far:
- reading resources, watching videos, exploring websites
- taking a quiz
- making a T-chart graphic organizer
- filming a videos
- writing about a topic
- answering questions
- posting in a Discussion Forum
- attending a synchronous Zoom session

All of these learning activities are designed to help you think more deeply about the topics presented.  They are ungraded (as should most activities be for your students) and optional.  This presents a very low-stakes engagement option for students.

The trick with most online courses is motivating the students to actually do these non-graded activities.

One key way is to emphasize how the activities will help students succeed in their assessments.  If for example, they have to analyze a case study in a major assignment, then they should be able to practice the skills needed to do this.  If students are giving a presentation, ask students to record themselves practicing their presentation (better yet, to practice in front of peers).  

There are several engaging learning activities and assessments that we will discuss next week.  For now, consider whether there are clear connections between the outcomes, activities, and assessments in your course.
