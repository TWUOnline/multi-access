> **CONNECTION**: We prioritize meaningful connections within our online courses. Learners have opportunities to engage with instructors, foster a sense of community with fellow students, and actively interact with course content in ways that promote deep understanding and engagement.

> **INCLUSION**: Our commitment to inclusion is at the heart of our online courses. We strive to create an accessible and supportive learning environment that embraces diversity, promotes cultural responsiveness, and nurtures a sense of belonging for all learners.

[ui-tab title="Learning Environment"]

At TWU, we primarily use Moodle as our Learning Management System (LMS).  We also support WordPress, as well as other ways to display course content (Bookdown, Pressbooks, etc.).  In this section we want to provide some examples of structured courses with clear and intuitive navigation.  Note that there is not one "Master Structure" at Trinity, as each instructor brings their own unique teaching presence into the online environment.  Rather, as you explore the course samples below, consider whether your course structure is easy to navigate and whether students can find what they are looking for.

### Sample course: LDRS 500: Leadership Foundations 
Welcome to LDRS 500, an online course designed to equip learners with the essential leadership skills needed in the dynamic landscape of the 21st century. In the slideshow presentation below, we will walk you through the structure this course, highlighting the key elements that make learning with us a seamless and enriching experience.

*Course Highlights:*

**Ease of Navigation**: We understand the importance of a user-friendly interface when it comes to online learning. Our course platform provides intuitive navigation, allowing learners to easily access course materials, units, and resources. With just a few clicks, learners can navigate through the course, find what they need, and focus on their learning journey.

**Clarity for Students**: Clarity is paramount in our online courses. Each unit is carefully structured to provide clear objectives, instructions, and learning outcomes. Within each unit, you will find organized lessons, multimedia content, and interactive activities that guide learners through the course material. Our goal is to ensure that learners have a clear understanding of what is expected and how to succeed in their learning.

**Engaging Course Content**: Engagement is key to effective learning, and LDRS 500 is designed to keep learners captivated throughout the course. We incorporate diverse and interactive content, such as videos, case studies, quizzes, and real-world examples, to enhance understanding of leadership principles. Leaners are encouraged to actively participate, share insights, and engage in thought-provoking discussions with their peers. Each unit follows a similar structure, so students know what to expect and how to engage with the course content and with their peers.

**Community**: At TWU, we believe that a strong community enhances the learning experience. Throughout LDRS 500, learners have the opportunity to connect with fellow students, instructors, and industry professionals. Discussion boards, group projects, and learning labs foster a sense of belonging and encourage collaborative learning. Learners are encouraged to engage with their peers, learn from instructors' experiences, and build lasting connections. 

Please see the presentation below, highlighting the ease of navigation, clarity for students, engaging course content, and a strong sense of community.

The WordPress platform enables students to interact through various channels, including discussion forums, live chats, and student blogs.

**E-Portfolios**: As part of the course, students have the opportunity to create their own blogs and e-Portfolios within the WordPress platform. This feature promotes active reflection, knowledge sharing, and peer feedback. By expressing their thoughts and insights through blogging, students develop a deeper understanding of the subject matter and engage in meaningful discussions with their peers.

**Learner Support Pages**: We understand that students may require additional assistance and guidance during their learning journey. Foundations 101 provides comprehensive learner support pages within WordPress, offering a wealth of resources, FAQs, and access to dedicated support channels. Our goal is to ensure that students receive the necessary assistance and thrive academically.

[ui-tab title="Course Connections"]

Online courses at Trinity Western University are designed so learners can make meaningful connections in their learning journey.  This  involves connections between the instructor and learners, learners and the course content, and between learners and their peers.

Facilitating meaningful connections in online courses is crucial for several reasons:

- Connecting with instructors allows students to establish a personal and supportive relationship with someone who can guide them through their learning journey. Instructors can provide valuable insights, clarify doubts, and offer individualized feedback, fostering a deeper understanding of the course material. 
   
- Connections with the course content enable students to engage more actively and meaningfully with the subject matter, promoting a sense of relevance and applicability. 
   
- Connecting with peers in online courses creates a collaborative and inclusive learning environment. Peer interactions facilitate knowledge exchange, the sharing of diverse perspectives, and the development of critical thinking skills. Building connections with instructors, course content, and peers not only enhances the learning experience but also promotes motivation, engagement, and a sense of belonging, ultimately leading to improved academic outcomes.

Below are some ways instructors can facilitate meaningful connections in online courses:

### Learners Connecting to Instructors

- Warmly welcome students to the course with a self-introduction (video or written form). Outline what they can expect and highlight key aspects of the course.
- Stay connected with students by offering ongoing support throughout the course.
- Utilize different channels such as emails, assessment feedback, welcome videos, weekly debriefing sessions, and regular updates to provide assistance and address any concerns.
- Ensure students diverse opportunities for formative feedback. This helps them gauge their progress and make necessary improvements.

### Learners Connecting to Course Content

- Develop assessments that effectively measure the achievement of the course learning outcomes and align with the course activities and resources.
- Design learning activities that scaffold and support students in building foundational knowledge and skills within the course.
- Provide opportunities for gradual progression and reinforcement of concepts and skills.
- Create engaging instructional materials (written/oral content, videos, graphics, readings, etc.), to support learners in achieving the learning outcomes.
- Use appropriate educational technology to promote student engagement and active learning. (e.g. [H5P](https://create.twu.ca/h5p/), e-portfolios, etc.)
  
The following slideshow provides practical examples of how to establish clear connections between learning outcomes, activities, and assessments, ensuring a cohesive learning experience.

### Learners Connecting to Peers

- Encourage learners to introduce themselves to the class. This helps foster a sense of connection and community among students.
- Provide a peer support forum where learners can engage with each other for course-related questions or community-building activities. This forum serves as a platform for students to seek assistance, share insights, and foster collaborative learning. Encouraging participation in such forums enhances peer support and strengthens the sense of community within the course.
- Design learning activities and assessment to encourage student interactions.  E.g. group activities, team projects, peer assessment, interviews, presentation feedback, etc.
