## Planning Your Course

In this section we discuss the course design process and share techniques you can use in planning your online, face-to-face, or blended courses at TWU.


### Big Ideas and Essential Questions

![alt-text](rm22-268-business-sasi-22.jpg "Woman holding a poster on a white wall")

Designing a course is like planning, building, and moving into a house.  You start with asking some key questions:
- What is the course?  What are the **Big Ideas**, or the main take-aways?
- In an inquiry-based approach to learning, what are some **Essential Questions** learners may ask throughout the course?
- At a program level, how does this course fit in with the program?
- If a previous course exists, has there been any feedback from students and instructors?
…and the most important questions:
- Who are the students?  What is the typical age, work experience, culture, etc.? What are their interests, learning styles, and needs?​

One strategy we use before getting into the details of a course is identifying the **Big Ideas** (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). Below is an image from Stanford University (adapted) that takes us through the process of deciding the big ideas, essential questions, key knowledge and skills, and learning activities.

### Instructional Design Models
There are several key models that influence the way we design online courses. Two that we'll focus on are the ADDIE model and Backwards Design.  

The **ADDIE Process** illustrates 5 phases of course development:

**Backwards Design** (Fink, 2003; Wiggins & McTighe, 2005) is where we first focus on the *target*: what knowledge, skills or attitudes do we want students to have at the end of the course?  Second, how will they *demonstrate* this?  Finally, what learning *experiences* will help students achieve this?

*Questions to Consider*  

:fa-question: Does the ADDIE model or Backwards Design work for you?  Would it be helpful in planning your course?


### Course Design Process at TWU
Every course is different, and every course design experience is different.  In this section we'd like to briefly share a typical process we follow in creating and revising our online courses at TWU.

*Please note: This process may not apply to your course! Often with time constraints, we speed things up to make sure the course is ready for students. During/after the course runs, we make further adjustments based on instructor and student feedback.*

In a typical full course design, here are some things you might expect:

#### Creating a Course Blueprint
The most important part of course design is the planning. After the initial stages of needs analysis (what do the students/instructors need) and hiring phase (who will write the course), the development teach creates a plan, or a blueprint of the course.

In developing this document we focus on the development of learning outcomes that are measurable, and then ensure that the supporting activities and assessments are mapped directly to these outcomes.

Here are key steps in filling out a blueprint:

1. Big Ideas and Essential Questions
2. Course Description
3. Course Learning Outcomes
   - Note to map out TWU's Student Learning Outcomes to the course learning outcomes
4. Course Assessment
   - Note to connect assessment to the course learning outcomes that are demonstrated
5. Unit Planning
6. Resources

#### Blueprint Examples
Below are some examples of part of a blueprint document.  For a current blueprint template for TWU courses, click on the following links: [TWU Course Blueprint Template - Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJ27S2OeEW01JFpICjWtvsYLj1a0SpD9dy7yoX8ttAQ/edit?usp=sharing); [TWU Course Blueprint Template - Word version](TWU-Course-Blueprint-Template.docx)

!!! Note in the blueprint that there is a table for 10 units.  This does not apply to all courses!!  If you happen to work with an Instructional Designer in planning out your course, a key question will be how to organize the learning/content.  This may work out to be 10 key units for a 12 week course, but each course is different.
