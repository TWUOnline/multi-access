## High Impact Practices

So how *should* we teach online?  What techniques make a difference for learners in terms of their success and overall experience in the course?

The Association of American Colleges and Universities (report on [High-Impact Educational Practices](https://carleton.ca/viceprovost/wp-content/uploads/kuh_2008_brief_overview.pdf); Kuh, 2008) has identified 10 activities or program components that have been shown to have high-impact on students.

1. First-Year Experiences
1. Common Intellectual Experiences
1. Learning Communities
1. Writing-Intensive Courses
1. Collaborative Assignments and Projects
1. Undergraduate Research
1. Diversity/Global Learning
1. Service Learning, Community-Based Learning
1. Internships
1. Capstone Courses and Projects
(ePortfolios included in some lists)

!!! Does your program/teaching incorporate any of these strategies?

So how does this translate to online teaching techniques?  In [Five High-Impact Teaching Practices](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1104478.pdf), L. Dee Fink discusses how these primarily institutional or curricular HIPs are can relate to a parallel set of high-impact teaching practices (HITPs)?  

Here are the key engagement strategies Fink suggests:

1. Helping students become meta-learners
   - Help students discover self-motivations for learning, teach students how learning works, develop effective learning practices (From [MetaLearning: Growing Self-Directed Learners](https://www.oakland.edu/Assets/upload/docs/CETL/ConferencePresentationMaterials2014/StephenCarroll/Metalearning-Slides.pdf))
2. Learning-centered course design
   - Use [Backward Design](https://multi-access.twu.ca/learning-design/backward-design): First, identify Learning outcomes, next decide assessment, and finally select learning activities.
3. Using small groups in a powerful way
   - e.g. “Team-Based Learning” (TBL) procedures involve group formation, appropriate assignments for groups, creating individual and group accountability, and prompt feedback)
4. Service-learning/community engagement—with reflection
   - Students engage in meaningful and challenging situations, putting theory into practice in real-world situations and reflecting on the experience.
5. Being a leader with your students
   - Show you care, motivate students, celebrate achievement, and be trustworthy.

!!! Yes! These are certainly strategies implemented at TWU. How have you used them in your class?  What strategy would you like to use more?

The University of Waterloo suggests similar themes in [High Impact Practices (HIPs) or Engaged Learning Practices](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/support/integrative-learning/high-impact-practices-hips-or-engaged-learning-practices):

1. Set **performance expectations** at  appropriately high levels, and effectively communicate these expectations to students
1. Encourage students to invest significant and meaningful time and effort on **authentic, complex tasks** over an extended period of time
1. Add **meaningful interactions** amongst students and between faculty and students about substantive matters
1. **Challenge students’ ways of thinking**, increase interactions with individuals with experiences and life experiences different from their own, Experiences with diversity
1. Provide frequent, timely and constructive **feedback**
1. Increase periodic, structured opportunities to **reflect and integrate learning**
1. Provide opportunities to discover relevance of learning through **real-world applications**, or add a real-world/authentic experience
1. Add a **public demonstration** of competence

!!! What have you found that impacts learners success in your course?
