### Images & Graphic Organizers

Images and graphic organizers can be powerful tools in many types of assignments. Just as we use visuals in our teaching for various reasons, students can include them in assignments to engage the reader, present complex information quickly and clearly, and communicate effectively.

In the resources below you'll see several digital tools that may be useful for you in your teaching, as well as for your students in their assignments.  Be sure to give enough instructions and guidance when recommending a tool, and ensure the focus is on demonstrating the mastery of a course learning outcome (not the technology).
