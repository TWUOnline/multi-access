## Thoughts by a Subject Matter Expert

> The design process was very efficient and streamlined with relevant feedback from the design team at every stage. My experience working in the content using the blueprint and unit development guidance by the Instructional Designer was extremely positive with both Karen Roeck and Mara Chequer. Both provided excellent support and ideas in a format that allowed organization of content prior to the process with the blueprint, and walking alongside reviewing the content once completed. The benefits I believe will result from working in the content is that it will provide students with current course resources and materials that are continually updated by a Subject Matter Expert. By having courses go through this process, students will have a uniform Moodle experience regardless of the individual instructor or the course itself.  Navigating the course shell will follow the same pattern as their other courses and the consistency will positively impact the student learning experience.

*Faculty Testimonial for Course Design Process*

Like most professors, except for professors in the Education Department, I have
never taken any formal education courses, so my experience of the course design
process with the TWU instructional designers, most of whom are also certified
teachers, has been educational, constructive, and collaborative. I worked
specifically with Jessica David in developing WRTG 100, ENGL 103, and ENGL 102,
and I learnt a lot about intentionality, student learning, and assessment. I am
particularly grateful for having undergone this course design process for an
on-line environment because it has also made my courses in the physical
classroom better in structure, student engagement, and assessment. I have had
very positive experiences of the course design process because of the
instructional designersâ€™ professionalism, open communication, and flexibility. I
have also found that coming into this development process with a willingness to
learn and to make changes even to courses that I have taught for many years
resulted in having greater peace of mind especially in an ever changing learning
environment where I could have confidence that the courses that have been
developed collaboratively would help me pivot and adjust to whatever learning
challenges may come my way in a world of uncertainty where the classroom could
be anywhere.
