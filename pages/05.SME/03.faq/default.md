## FAQ for Course Developers

* **What are the advantages of having the content for a course go through the Design Process?**
In your daily practice as a teacher of the subject, there are many ways to instruct your students. Creating content fidelity ensures that students from different cohorts receive the same quality of content, learning, and experiences. Designing a course allows you to be the expert on the subject and create the learning environment and plan the application from the beginning. This adds flexibility, quality, and coherence to the course.

* **What are the steps of the Design Process?**
The key steps in developing an online course at TWU are: 1. Pre-planning, 2. Planning (completion of a Blueprint), 3. Writing, 4. Production and 5. Review.

* **Who owns the content I write?**
It is essential to create Open Educational Resources that are available to all faculty. Because we are promoting course fidelity for each cohort, the university can use the course for its own purposes at any time - including giving the material to another instructor, modifying the course, etc. This includes Moodle material. Please inquire about your specific course because we know that there will be special and unique cases.


* **How long does the Design Process usually takes?**
There are many factors that affect the timeline of a course development, however we consider that in average, completing the Design Process can take between 6 to 10 months.

* **What type of support will I get from the Online Learning Team?**
No matter the service we provide, our team is always there to guide you and make available to you resources that can be used in your online teaching, the creation of learning activities, consultations about technology, and if you're part of a course development, we can help you at all steps.
