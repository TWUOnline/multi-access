## Peer Feedback

One last important topic to cover in our assessment unit is about the value of peer feedback.
Peer assessment can:

- improve student work/performance
- offer timely feedback
- reduce grading workload
- help make your grading criteria more clear (as students use it to evaluate their peers)
- allow for critical reflection (of students' own work & their peers)

To this last point, consider as well asking students to self-evaluate their work, acknowledging feedback from peers and/or the instructor and setting goals for improvement.
