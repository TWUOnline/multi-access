## Assessment

A reminder again that this course is learner-directed and ungraded - so this section is what you make of it!
We would love for you to participate in the Discussion forums and we build our Community of Inquiry and support each other in our online adventures.

For this second unit, please see the Discussion Forum in Unit 2 in Moodle.  Later on, we may post discussions in our open [TONE website](http://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/april-2020/overview), but in case you haven't tackled discussion forums in Moodle (like your students have to!) then please head on over to the Discussion forum and give it a try!


### Unit 2 Discussion: Course Design Process
Feel free to answer one or all of the following:
1. What ideas seem helpful to you as you start to plan and design your course?
2. What course elements can you include in your design now?  What will you implement later?
3. What key questions do you have about online course design?

!!! To write your discussion post, see the Discussions tab in Moodle and click on the Unit 2 Discussion Forum.

## Checking Your Learning

:fa-check: consider the process for designing a course and what techniques apply to your own course design;

:fa-check: discuss the components in an online unit of study, and the variety of approaches to present content;

:fa-check: write effective learning outcomes that are linked to the assessment and learning activities in a unit;
