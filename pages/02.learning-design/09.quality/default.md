# What Makes a Quality Online Course at TWU?


## Quality Framework
At TWU, we have a commitment to student success - on campus and online.  As a campus instructor, you may measure a successful term by hearing stories from your students, reviewing your SETL surveys, comparing the grades you give, or by other means.

At TWU Online we want to support faculty in creating quality online courses to help students thrive in the online environment.  We structure our framework for quality around three themes:

- **STRUCTURE**: Courses have clear instructions, expectations, and navigation.
- **CONNECTION**: Students connecting to content, instructors, and peers
- **INCLUSION:** Courses promote accessibility, culturally responsiveness, relatedness.


Below you will find suggestions for structuring your content, planning for connections, and creating a welcoming and inclusive learning environment for your learners.

Also see the [Checklist for Quality Online Courses at Trinity Western University](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13TD6ZdTnCX3AQjxlHLoPZGCAGTZMRBzvGkKww1IcbpY/edit) with standards adapted from [Quality Matters](https://www.qualitymatters.org/qa-resources/rubric-standards/higher-ed-rubric).

!!! For more detailed instructions and tips for design, see the [Instructor's Guide for Online Courses at TWU](https://multi-access.twu.ca/teach/instructor-guide).

### Connection
Now that you have your basic structure set up for your online course, how do you design a quality online learning experience for your students?  Key to successful online learning is a connection - between learners, between the instructor and learners, and between the learner and the content.  See the graphic below as well as the [Community of Inquiry](https://coi.athabascau.ca/coi-model/) website for more details.
