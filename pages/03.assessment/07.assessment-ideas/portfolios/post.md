### Portfolios

Portfolios, whether electronic or otherwise, are another common type of assessment in online courses.    

Clemson University (n.d.) categorizes portfolios into three main types:

1. **Showcase portfolio**: Highlights achievements.
1. **Learning portfolio**: Demonstrates the learning process with a focus on feedback.
1. **Assessment portfolio**: Used to assess students’ competency on certain standards or topics.

 *Source: [Wiley Education Services - Center for Teaching and Learning](https://ctl.wiley.com/e-portfolios-and-their-uses-in-higher-education/)*

Scully et al. (2018) explains that in the university context, "learning portfolios are typically used with the dual intention of (i) encouraging critically self-reflective lifelong learning and (ii) gathering evidence of broad skills and competencies that may enhance future employment prospects" (p.iii).  The authors warn portfolios are only effective if instructors and learners understand the process of reflection. "**Effortful design, explicit scaffolding and sufficient time are needed**" (p.10).

If you've ever created a portfolio yourself, you know it takes a lot of reflection and critical thinking as you select evidence of your learning or achievements. An ePortfolio in particular adds an element of vulnerability, as learners may share their successes and struggles openly. This is a great opportunity for peers to learn the process/products of learning from each other.

## Sample E-Portfolio Directions

#### ePortfolio Development for LDRS 697

As you work through the material in this course, you will also be asked to develop your ePortfolio site as a part of the weekly assessment. The objective of this assignment is to provide you with the opportunity to organize, consolidate, and create your learning, that is, to review and make sense of your experiences over the MA Lead program.

You will receive formative feedback on your ePortfolio site in week 6 and week 12.

Here is what should be included in your ePortfolio site by the end of LDRS 697.

Your site should include the following pages:

- Home (with a clear description of the purpose of your site)
- About Me (telling your reader a little more about who you are)
- My Leadership Story (where you have posted 4 artifacts with descriptions and reflections)
- My Leadership Philosophy (this page will be completed in 698)
- My Action Research Report (this page will be completed in 698)
- Reflection on My Leadership Journey (this page will be completed in 698)
- Reflection Posts (Blog) (there should be 10 posts in total by the end of 697)

!!! Please refer to the ePortfolio tutorial links below to help you complete your ePortfolio development.

## Creating an E-Portfolio

Here are some steps to help you create a meaningful e-portfolio.  Remember, an ePortfolio is both a product (a digital collection of artifacts) and a process (of reflecting on those artifacts and what they represent). In other words, your e-portfolio will be a website that you create where you will be able to share important assignments, projects, and reflections about your  journey at TWU and how you plan to apply what you've learned.

Making and then sharing an ePortfolio with others is somewhat like telling a story: the story of your learning journey.

With that, let's begin!


[ui-accordion independent=true open=none]
[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 1: Creating an ePortfolio site"]

:fa-film: Watch the following video tutorial on how to create a website using WordPress. This video provides you with an overview of all the necessary steps. Do not worry if you start to feel overwhelmed—we will break these steps down for you one by one in the course activities.

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/2b86e3f4-a831-4bcd-817e-a2d4c1da1cdc?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none;"></iframe>

:fa-firefox: Next, go to <https://create.twu.ca> and sign up for your own WordPress site. Please read all the prompts and instructions carefully! When you have activated your site (look for a notification to your TWU email), then you are ready to create.

Be sure to read the Privacy Statement carefully before clicking “I Agree.” The information provided gives you excellent guidance regarding digital citizenship, privacy, and how to build a professional digital persona.

Once you have created your domain name and you have a Uniform Resource Locator (URL, also known as a web address) you will need to sign in to your WordPress site to complete the following learning activities.

:fa-comments: Be sure to include a link to your e-Portfolio as a part of your introductory post in the Introduction Forum in the LDRS 697 Moodle site.

*A couple of notes about WordPress...*

Your e-Portfolio site is built in WordPress and hosted for you by Trinity Western University. If you have never used this platform before, or if you have no experience with it, the information provided in this orientation will provide you with a step by step guide to help you create your website in order to get it ready for your e-Portfolio.

WordPress is an open source **Content Management System (CMS),** which allows users to build websites and blogs. WordPress is the most popular blogging system on the web and allows you to customize and easily manage your e-Portfolio. If you already have your own website or you have previous experience using WordPress, you may set up your e-Portfolio on it and skip the set-up steps in these units, but you still need to complete the learning activities.

Because WordPress is hosted by Trinity Western University, it is free for any TWU student to use. However, you must create and use your own domain name. A domain name is your website’s address on the Internet. This is what your users will type in their browsers to reach your site. For example, my site is: <https://create.twu.ca/drheatherstrong>.

Make sure that you choose a domain name that is related to you, easy to pronounce and spell, and easy to remember. Once you have done that, we suggest you write all this information somewhere you can access it easily – just in case.

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 2: Selecting a template for your ePortfolio"]

The visual appearance of your WordPress site is controlled by a WordPress theme. WordPress themes are professionally designed templates that you can install on your website to change its appearance.

By default, the MA Lead Template you chose comes with a basic theme. We have created a few MA Lead templates for you to choose from so that your site structure is already set up and ready to go.

To get started, we would like you to choose one of these three MA Lead templates:

[MA Lead ePortfolio Template 1 (twu.ca)](https://create.twu.ca/maleadtemp1/)

[MA Lead ePortfolio Template 2 (twu.ca)](https://create.twu.ca/maleadtemp2/)

[MA Lead ePortfolio Template 3 (twu.ca)](https://create.twu.ca/maleadtemp3/)

When you choose one of these options from the your new site will come with a simple menu and instructions for your 697 and 698 e-Portfolio.

**Note:** You don’t need to finalize all of your settings right away. You will be able to customize it much better once you have some content in your e-Portfolio.

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 3: Select your privacy settings"]

:fa-film: Watch the following video on restricting access to your website. You may not want your site to be made public or you may not be ready to make it public yet. This video will show you how to restrict access to your WordPress site:

[plugin:youtube](https://youtu.be/ioTDqNM-WfQ)

Next, follow these steps. There are several options for privacy.

Go to your site dashboard. Next select, **Settings » Reading**. Scroll down to the bottom and you will see options to configure restricted access.

![](C:\Users\Heather.Strong\Documents\GitHub\ldrs-master\pages\18.697\05.U1\_1-4\Picture1.png)

The top two options are open on the web, but you can still protect your posts with a password.

***Visible only to registered users of this network*** includes all students, staff and faculty at TWU who are logged in to their [create.twu.ca](http://create.twu.ca) site.

***Visible only to registered users of this site*** means that the learner will have to add users from the class who they want to see the site.

***Visible only to administrators of this site*** means that the site is private and only the learner and the network administrators can see it. These settings apply regardless of where the user or potential site visitor might be.

[**Click here**](https://edtechuvic.ca/edci335/a01-social-spaces/) for a view of what a password-protected post on a public site looks like.

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 4: Adding Pages to your e-Portfolio"]
Now that you have a template and have set your privacy settings, it's time to add content!  

All WordPress themes provide two options for adding content: you can choose to add content to a *page* or you can choose to add content to a *post*. They may look the same and they have nearly the same editing interface, so what’s the difference?

**Pages vs Posts**
The biggest difference between pages and posts are that posts are timestamped, whereas pages are timeless.

Pages are for static content. They do not have a publish date. Use pages when it does not make sense to list the content by date because you want your visitors to always be able to see that content in that spot, no matter when they visit your ePortfolio. Most themes support comments at the bottom of pages.

For information on creating a post, see the next section. For now, watch the following video on creating a page.

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/d97c17d2-0689-451e-80f8-971ea74f4db7?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none;"></iframe>


[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 5: Adding Posts to your e-Portfolio"]
Posts are for timely content. They have a publish date, and they are displayed in reverse chronological order on your site’s blog page. Older posts can “fall off” the blog page (the content is still kept, but no longer visible). Posts are what you should think of when you hear the term “blog post.” All themes have a link to comments, and this is where readers can click to write a comment in response to your post. This may be a handy way to receive feedback from your peers! Also, you can categorize your posts, which is useful to help readers locate posts on your blog.

Watch the following video on creating a post.

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/62301803-5d90-4589-8083-e9473b52bebd?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none;"></iframe>

**Categories and Tags**

Now that you understand the differences between pages and posts, you my be wondering what categories and tags are. Categories and tags are two ways to group your content. Categories are meant for broad grouping, similar to a table of contents. All WordPress posts must be filed under a category. Tags are meant to be granular and descriptive. They can be used to describe specific details of your posts. They are not required for every post. For more detailed information about categories and tags, check out the Beginner’s Guide for WordPress page outlining categories vs tags at: https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/categories-vs-tags-seo-best-practices-which-one-is-better/

**Different Types of Posts**

Different themes may give you options for how the post is displayed on the blog page. When you are in the back end editor for your post, you can select different formats.

Here are some common formats:

*Standard*: This option is generally for text content. If you add a featured image, then the image will be added to the top of the post and be featured on the homepage.

*Gallery*: This option is great if you have a couple images to share. It will generate a slide show of your images at the top of the post and on the homepage. All you need to do is add the images to the post and make sure the gallery option is selected.

*Image*: This option is very similar to a Standard post with featured image, except that none of the text from the post will display on the homepage.

*Video*: This option is very similar to a Standard post. Only the text will display on the homepage unless you add a featured image. To add a video, you will first need to add it to the media gallery by upload or by URL.

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 6: Adding Images and hyperlinks to your e-Portfolio"]

Using different types of media to represent your artifacts is a great way to make your portfolio dynamic and keep your audience engaged. Text-heavy pages can get cumbersome regardless of how you arrange it. Media can help with breaking up content or replacing text all together. Consider how you can “show what you know” rather than just simply telling.

Watch the following video on adding media to your portfolio.

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://web.microsoftstream.com/embed/video/7598f6a8-c7e0-471b-acdb-30e58dce337c?autoplay=false&showinfo=true" allowfullscreen style="border:none;"></iframe>


To add media, first, place your cursor where you want your media to appear.  Then, click on the “Add Media” button.

Select the item you wish to insert or select the “Upload files” tab to upload your media.  Once you have selected or uploaded the image you want to add, you will see a checkbox next to the thumbnail confirming your selection, and see information about it displayed in the Attachment Details pane on the right hand side of the media uploader interface.  Edit this according to your preferences, then click the blue “Insert” button.

**Setting a Feature Image**

When editing a page or post, scroll down the page and on the right hand side look for  “Feature Image”. Click on “Set feature image” to upload or select an image. Don’t forget to click “Update” to save your changes!

**Media Tips**

Media can also be an alternative to simply hyperlinking all your artifacts. Instead of sending your audience off to another site or tab, embedding media can  keep your audience on a page.  Some options can include:

*Photos or Videos*

You do not need to create everything from scratch.  There are many sources that provide professional-looking, royalty-free images and video.
- Unsplash https://unsplash.com/
- Pexels https://www.pexels.com/
- Wikimedia Commons https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page

When it comes to creating videos, there is a lot you can do with your smartphone’s camera. If you need to record your screen, but don’t have screen capturing software, then consider using a web-conferencing tool (like Zoom), and record your screen share. As for screen capturing tools, there are many freemium web-based ones or Chrome extensions that are very user-friendly. Just do a Google search and find one that works for you.

*Infographics*

If you are looking to create something visual, but still informative, infographics can do just that. Here are a few free (or freemium) web-based graphic design tools that are very user-friendly:
- Canva http://www.canva.com
- Pikochart https://piktochart.com

*Podcasts*

Maybe some of your work might have more impact spoken or heard. Whatever the reason, don’t rule out audio as a form of media. To record, you can use the voice memo app on a smartphone and upload the mp3 file directly to WordPress. Alternatively, you can use a web tool like Soundcloud  to record, edit and save. Soundcloud easily embeds into WordPress by simply copying and pasting the URL on to your page/post.

*Embedding PDFs*

Since papers are common items to artifact, embedding PDFs right into your website is a good option in comparison to linking them, which requires the audience to either open it in a new tab or download it.  We have the PDF Embedder plugin which you can use. To activate the plugin, from your dashboard click the Plugins link. Next, search for pdf in the Search for installed plugins… text box and finally click Activate for the PDF Embedder plugin. When you upload your PDF via “Add Media” your PDF will be automatically embedded on your page.

**Formatting Lists**

When we want to add text below a bullet without adding a new bullet, you will notice that if you hit the enter key then the backspace key, you only to get frustrated that you are back on the line you just left! Here is a handy tip: click Shift+Enter to start a new line without adding a bullet, and when your ready for another line with a bullet click Enter (as normal).

- This is my first bullet (click Shift+Enter)
this is my line of text without a bullet (click Enter)
- This is my second bullet

**DON’T FORGET!**

After you have added content and before you leave the page, do not forget to click the blue “Update” button to save your work.


[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 7: Adding Artifacts to your e-Portfolio"]

**Artifacts – What are they?**

Every time you create an artifact, a post, or a page on your portfolio you are creating a Learning Artifact. Artifacts are demonstrations of your learning. Artifacts can be photographs, documents, video, audio files, digital files – essentially the form of the artifact is up to you!

**Using the TWU Portfolio Plugin**

The purpose of this plugin is to help students categorize their learning artifacts. Using this plugin is optional, but the practice of categorizing is strongly encouraged. See the ‘TWU Portfolio’ item in your Navigation Menu.

To create a new Artifact, you can hover over that link and choose ‘Add New’, or you can hover over the ‘New’ link in the top admin menu and choose ‘Artifact’.

If you don’t see the ‘TWU Portfolio’ menu, you might need to activate the ‘TWU Portfolio Helper’ plugin.

All Artifacts in the Learning Portfolio will be categorized using ‘Artifact Types‘ according to the TWU Student Learning Outcomes or Ways of Knowing, or you can create your own categories according to your own interests, career goals, or experiences.

**Categories to Consider Using to Organize your Posts**
Use the [MA Leadership Competencies](https://www.twu.ca/leadership-ma/competency-model) to categorize your posts.

-   Values and Ethics
-   Higher Ordered Thinking & Analysis
-   Visioning and Strategic Thinking
-   Adaptability and Change
-   Results
-   Team Leadership
-   People Development
-   Innovation
-   Service & Quality Orientation
-   Relationships & Collaboration
-   Planning & Organizing

Your artifacts may be seen by your peers, instructors, and possibly co-workers and potential employers – so it makes them an ideal place to showcase your learning, growth, and development.  

**You are a Curator!**

Remember that you are the curator of your artifacts.  Over the time it takes you to complete your degree your artifacts will reflect the richness of your learning.  It is up to you to document your learning by uploading (and removing) artifacts that best represent this journey.

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 8: Reflecting on your Artifacts"]

Reflection may seem intuitive; however, a deliberate thought process ​(Dye, 2011; Moon, 2004; Tracey & Hutchinson, 2018)​ greatly increases the insights found through reflection.  Consider the pedestrian answer “fine” to the classic question “how was your day?”  Reworking the question to “what was the best part of your day and why?” or “what would you do-over today and why?” elicits a much richer and informative response.  The same is true for the reflective process.


There are many different ways to reflect because there are many different reasons why reflection is needed.  For example, you may want to account for what you have learned ​(McAlpine & Weston, 2000)​, or you may want to explore and generate future action based on what you already know ​(Tracey & Hutchinson, 2018)​, or you may want to evaluate or analyze what you have learned ​(Syed et al., 2012)​. Take a look at the diagram below.  Each circle represents one of the above reasons for reflection.  Where the circles overlap, you will notice that the color gets darker.  This is to represent how the customization of different reflective prompts can lead to deeper and more profuse responses ​(Kirkman & Brownhill, 2020)​.  There is no one correct way to reflect ​(Boesch et al., 2015; Dye, 2011)​; however, the more you personalize your reflective process, the more value and meaning you will be able to distill into your ePortfolio.

![](Effective Content 3-Circle Venn Diagram.png)

Figure 1. Reasons for reflection

**Where do I begin?**

Start your reflection with a brief description of your artifact.  In addition to explaining what it is, share the context of how or when this artifact was created so that your audience can understand what work was involved. Then consider which of the following reflection prompts below you would like to answer based on which are best suited to the purpose of your ePortfolio, your audience, and your artifact.

**Reflection Prompts**

**Help!  How do I put all my reflective thoughts together?**

Think about what flows best. Take a look below at the reflective structures Syed, Scoular, and Reaney (2012) have developed.  They have done a great job of integrating all the reasons for reflecting into one progression.

The first one is more evaluative in nature, and second one is more explorative in nature.
