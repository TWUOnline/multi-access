## Course Design Process at TWU
Every course is different, and every course design experience is different.  In this section we'd like to briefly share a typical process we follow in creating and revising our online courses at TWU.

*Please note: This process may not apply to your course! Often with time constraints, we speed things up to make sure the course is ready for students. During/after the course runs, we make further adjustments based on instructor and student feedback.*

In a typical full course design, here are some things you might expect:

## Glossary of Terms

**Subject Matter Expert (SME)** - Instructor who plans and writes the course material.

**Instructional Designer (ID)** - works with instructors to design online courses.

**Facilitator** - In some modalities, courses will have a facilitator to guide students in their learning at designated Learning Labs.  Note Facilitators are not subject matter experts, but are training in online learning facilitation (see [Graduate Certificate in Adult Learning: Coaching and Facilitation](https://www.twu.ca/leadership-ma/graduate-certificate-adult-learning-coaching-and-facilitation)).

**Synchronous** - It means that the instructor and the students are engaged in the same course content and each other at the same time, but may do so from different places. In order to hold live classes or meetings, instructors interact in real time through streaming audio, video, and presentations.

**Asynchronous** - Asynchronous learning in an online environment allows students to access information at their own pace and does not include a live lecture component, however, there could be a prerecorded component as part of the online learning experience.

**FAR Centre** -  The letters FAR stand for Facilitated Academic Resources.  FAR Centres are TWU micro-campuses located around the world where Global Education Specialists coach and facilitate learning for learners taking TWU courses toward TWU degrees. A FAR Centre is a collaboration between TWU and an institutional university or college partner.

**TWU Student Learning Outcomes** - All TWU courses have course learning outcomes that must align with the TWU [Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/academics/student-learning-outcomes).  Note some programs have additional outcomes, such as the [MA Leadership Competency Model](https://www.twu.ca/leadership-ma/competency-model).
