Designing online courses: What story should we tell?

Designing a course is like telling a story.  We consider who our audience is, what they already know about the subject, how we can engage them in our story, and what we want them to learn from it.  Consider also – who is the storyteller? An inspirational instructor is passionate about their subject and is able to captivate students’ attention.  A lesson, whether online or in class, should be engaging and should give our learners a experience that impacts them – on an academic and personal level.  So how do we get there?  Well, that’s where course design comes in…

How Do We Design A Course?
A key approach we use in designing courses is Backwards Design.

Backwards design is a contrast to the traditional method of designing curriculum with the topics as the focus.  With the backwards approach, the end results help map out the course and leads to more productive activities and assessments. 

Note too in the graphic above that the three key components of the course are connected.  Learning outcomes inform assessment and activity choice; activities are designed to prepare students for assessments to demonstrate understanding of the outcomes.

 As you design your course outcomes, assessments, and learning activities, keep in mind what will motivate and inspire your students.
