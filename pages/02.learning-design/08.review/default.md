# Ensuring Quality in TWU Online Courses


## Quality Checklist
At TWU, we have a [Checklist for Quality Online Courses at Trinity Western University](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13TD6ZdTnCX3AQjxlHLoPZGCAGTZMRBzvGkKww1IcbpY/edit) with standards adapted from [Quality Matters](https://www.qualitymatters.org/qa-resources/rubric-standards/higher-ed-rubric).

As we develop and review online courses, here are the items we discuss.  
!! Note that often these are a work in progress!!  For example, we are currently implementing Blackboard Ally in all TWU courses to ensure accessibility requirements are met.  

---

### Course Overview and Introduction

- There is a self-introduction by the instructor, welcoming students to the course and explaining key aspects of what to expect in the course.
- The Course Overview provides a course description, learning outcomes, and list of assessments.
- Instructions are clear on how to navigate the course and how to get started.
- Learners are asked to introduce themselves to the class.

---

### Learning Outcomes

- Course learning outcomes reflect the course description and level of the course and  achievement can be inferred from learner performance on assessments
- The module/unit learning outcomes are consistent with the course-level outcomes and can be inferred from learner performance on assessment tasks.
- The learning outcomes are stated clearly and written from the learner’s perspective.
- There is a clear relationship between the course/unit learning outcomes, learning activities, and assessments.

### Assessment

- The assessments allow instructors to infer achievement of the course learning outcomes and are consistent with course activities and resources.
- Specific and descriptive criteria (rubrics, marking schemes) are provided as necessary for the evaluation of students’ work and participation.
- The assessments are sequenced, varied, flexible, and appropriate to the content being assessed.
- Learners have opportunities to review their performance and assess their own learning throughout the course (pre-tests, automated self-tests, reflective assignments, etc.).
- Sufficient and varied opportunities for formative feedback are provided.
- The learner workload is appropriate and reasonable for the level and number of credits for the course.
- Summative assessments only consider achievement in relation to learning outcomes, not compliance with course logistics (i.e. late penalties).

---

### Instructional Materials

- The instructional materials (written/oral content, videos, graphics, readings, etc.), support learners in achieving the learning outcomes.
- Course materials and resources are up-to-date, relevant, and appropriate for the level of the course.
- The instructional materials are free of bias, culturally inclusive, and provide flexibility and choice.
- A variety of instructional materials are used in the course.

### Learning Activities and Learner Interaction

- Learning activities support learners in achieving the learning outcomes and completing assessments.
- Learning activities provide scaffolding opportunities for building foundational knowledge and skills within the course.
- Learning activities foster student-instructor, student-content, and if appropriate to the course, student-student interaction.
- The requirements for learner interaction are clearly stated.

---

### Course Technology

- The technology used in the course supports the learning outcomes, activities and assessments.
- Tools promote student engagement and active learning.
- Students are instructed on how to protect their data and privacy.
- All third-party materials are identified, cited and permission requested if necessary.
- A variety of technology is used in the course.

### Learner Support

- Instructions for accessing support (instructor, IT, library, student services), are clearly stated in the course overview and when appropriate, throughout the course.
- Instructors provide support for students throughout the course (e.g. though emails, assessment feedback, welcome videos, weekly debriefing, and other updates).
- Learners are able to participate in a peer support forum (e.g. Learning Café), for course-related questions or community-building activities.

---

### Accessibility and Usability

- The course navigation facilitates ease of use.
- The overall course is structured in a logical, consistent, sequenced, and efficient manner.
- Instructions are clear, include rationale for activities and assessments, and provide seamless connections between the various elements in the course.
- The course provides accessible text, videos and images for diverse learners.
