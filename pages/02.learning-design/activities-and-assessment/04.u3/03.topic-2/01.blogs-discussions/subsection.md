### Discussions & Blogs

#### Discussions Forums
Discussion forums are a popular form of assessment for online courses.  Which means, if students are taking several online courses at once...there is a certain amount of *forum fatigue* they may experience!  Be sure to craft your discussion questions in a way that meets the unit learning outcomes, but also inspires collaboration, inquiry, and critical thinking.

In the activity below there are several resources and guides for facilitating discussions. In particular, pay attention to the various activity types you can have in discussion forums.  For example:

1. **Web Field Trips**: Instructor provides a link or a series of links. Students follow the link(s) and report back through an instructor-defined set of questions.
1. **Brainstorming**: Students set forth a series of ideas on a given topic without evaluation.
1. **Problem-Solving**: Small groups work out a solution to a problem.
1. **Writing Groups**: Students work together in groups of four or five to share drafts and provide peer response and peer-editing.
1. **Case Analysis**: Students work independent on a common case followed by group analysis in the board.
1. **Collaborative Writing**: Workgroups work together to create a single document – proposals and analytical reports work well – which they then post to the larger group for critique.
1. **Cooperative Debate**: Workgroups present perspectives on a particular issue, followed by a whole group consensus-building discussion.
1. **Discussions of Course Readings**: Instructor creates threaded discussions
around assigned readings. Threads may include pre-reading (anticipation) activities, interpretations, evaluations, etc.
1. **Research Bank**: Students and instructor contribute links and citations to a common area for a classwide research topic.

Another reflective learning tool is a blog.  It may take some courage for some students to post their thoughts online (and for faculty to step out of Moodle), but it can be very effective in helping students demonstrate their learning.

It's important to let students know that blogs can be kept private.  Students can share their link with their instructor, or post their link on Moodle so other students can see.  It's important to go over privacy considerations with students, as well as [netiquette guidelines](http://teach.ufl.edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/NetiquetteGuideforOnlineCourses.pdf)

Here are some benefits to consider from [How Do Blogs Support Learning?](https://resources.depaul.edu/teaching-commons/teaching-guides/technology/other-teaching-tools/Pages/blogs.aspx)
- **Blogs help grow learning communities** by allowing students to share their own perspectives and experiences while learning about those of their classmates.
- **Blogs let students take ownership of their learning**, offering them a space to tease out tough problems, explore possible solutions, and basically do the hard work that critical thinking requires.
- **Blogs encourage creativity of expression** by giving students a platform to experiment with a variety of genres, allowing for the unique personalities of both students and faculty to emerge.
- **Blogs create multimodal spaces capable of hosting a wide variety of multimedia**: oftentimes images, audio, video, and other media can communicate ideas more effectively than written text.
- **Blogs give students opportunities to address audiences other than their professors:** their posts could be read by other students, their parents, and visitors from across the globe.
- **Blogs foster opportunities for reflection** and provide them with tangible evidence of their learning over time: students can look at their previous posts to identify recurrent patterns in their thinking, times of change or growth, and other markers of learning and development.
- **Blogs familiarize students with widely-used web content platforms**: The knowledge and skills gained by writing and maintaining a blog are transferrable to a wide variety of work contexts, as blogging platforms (particularly Wordpress) power an increasing number of websites around the world.

Tony Bates also promotes blogs as he discussing [Open pedagogy](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/11-4-open-pedagogy/) in *Teaching in a Digital Age*.  He quotes Hegarty (2015), in describing eight attributes of open pedagogy. Consider how your class blogs can impact more than just your class.

- **participatory technologies**: socially constructed media such as blogs, wikis and other ‘sharing’ social media;
people, openness and trust: students’ willingness to learn is fragile, with participation and interactions unlikely to flourish unless an element of trust can be built (Mak et., 2010);
- **innovation and creativity**: finding new models of teaching and learning that better exploit OER and more emphasis on choosing digital technologies and methods that encourage the sharing of knowledge and resources;
- **sharing ideas and resources**: an open pedagogy needs peers to share willingly within a connected and trusting and professional community;
- **connected community**: a technologically linked community with common interests;
- **learner-generated**: this requires ‘opening up’ the process to empower students to take the lead, solve problems, and work collectively to produce artifacts that they share, discuss, reconfigure, and redeploy
- **reflective practice**: when students and teachers collaborate in partnerships, it facilitates deeper pedagogical reflection
- **peer review**: Conole (2014) sees learners as publishers and users of a range of open tools, with peer interactions and critique embedded in the learning experience.
