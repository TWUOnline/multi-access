In this section, we highlight a variety assessment techniques you may want to consider for your course. As you browse the assessment bank, consider the following:
- Does the assessment allow students to demonstrate their understanding of the learning outcomes?
- Are there any barriers to learning?  Technical requirements?
- Is there an opportunity for learners to share their work with their peers, or beyond TWU?
- Will there be formative feedback, and opportunities to improve their work?
