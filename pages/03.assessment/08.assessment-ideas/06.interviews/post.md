Interviews provide faculty with an effective method of evaluating student learning. A student is evaluated on their performance and how well they meet their objectives, as well as on how they report their work, how easily they explain projects, etc. Faculty can also assist students in their thought process, correct them, provide growth opportunities, and mentor them.

In order for an interview to be successful, both participants' expectations must be clear from the beginning. It must be a quality interview that is limited in time, that way, the interviewee feels comfortable and can keep their focus on the subject at hand.

A rubric for qualifying an interview must be simple and clear, since what is sought is for the student to obtain clarity not so much on the topic to be discussed but also on what is expected of them.
