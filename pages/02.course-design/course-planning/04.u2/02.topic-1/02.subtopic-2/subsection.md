### Course Design Process at TWU
Every course is different, and every course design experience is different.  In this section we'd like to briefly share a typical process we follow in creating and revising our online courses at TWU.

*Please note: This process may not apply to your course! Often with time constraints, we speed things up to make sure the course is ready for students. During/after the course runs, we make further adjustments based on instructor and student feedback.*

Our Instructional Design team at TWU generally follows the following development process:

#### Creating a Course Blueprint
The most important part of course design is the planning. After the initial stages of needs analysis (what do the students/instructors need) and hiring phase (who will write the course), the development teach creates a plan, or a blueprint of the course.

In developing this document we focus on the development of learning outcomes that are measurable, and then ensure that the supporting activities and assessments are mapped directly to these outcomes.

Below are some examples of part of a blueprint document.  For a current blueprint template for TWU courses, click on the following links: [TWU Course Blueprint Template - Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XJ27S2OeEW01JFpICjWtvsYLj1a0SpD9dy7yoX8ttAQ/edit?usp=sharing); [TWU Course Blueprint Template - Word version](TWU-Course-Blueprint-Template.docx)

!!! Note in the blueprint that there is a table for 10 units.  This does not apply to all courses!!  If you happen to work with an Instructional Designer in planning out your course, a key question will be how to organize the learning/content.  This may work out to be 10 key units for a 12 week course, but each course is different.

### Learning Activities
