### #1: Learning is an EXPERIENCE
A key approach in course design is **Experiential Learning** - learning by **DOING**.  
Simon Fraser University (2010) has defined experiential learning as:

! "the strategic, active engagement of students in opportunities to learn through doing, and reflection on those activities, which empowers them to apply their theoretical knowledge to practical endeavours in a multitude of settings inside and outside of the classroom."

The **Experiential Learning** model was developed in the 70's by Kolb (influences by Piaget and Dewey), and explains a process of learning that is active and reflective.

Other key models related to experiential learning are:
- active learning,
- inquiry-based learning,
- problem-based learning, and
- collaborative learning.

In our condensed course, we won't examine these models in depth (unfortunately!), but please see the resources listed in the learning activity below.
