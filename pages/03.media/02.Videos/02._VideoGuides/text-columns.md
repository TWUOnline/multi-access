## Video Guides

Designing a course is like planning to build a house. There are a lot of details to think through, and you start with asking some key questions, such as who is the house for, what features are required, what support is needed, what will make it feel like a home?, etc.

Similarly, for course design, we ask:

❔ Who is the **learner**?  What is the average age, work experience, culture, etc.? What are their interests, learning styles, and needs? Why are they taking the course?  
❔ Why is this course important?  What are the **big ideas**, or the main take-aways for learners?   
❔ What are the course **learning outcomes?** How will students demonstrate their understanding of these outcomes?  
❔ How will the course be **delivered**?  How will students connect with their peers, with the instructor, and with the content?  
❔ If a previous course exists, has there been any **feedback** from students and instructors?

Notice, we didn't start with these questions...

📕 What textbook should I use for the course?  
📘 What topics are covered in the textbook chapters?  
📗 What publisher resources are available (e.g. testbank, PowerPoint presentations)?  
📙 What topics will fit into my 16 weeks course?  


Instead, we use what's called **Backward Design** to develop the course.
