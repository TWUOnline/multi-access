#### Activity 3.4: Resources on Blogs
:fa-book: Select from the following resources:

- Section 11.4 [Open pedagogy](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/11-4-open-pedagogy/) in *Teaching in a Digital Age*.
- [Using Blogs in the Classroom](https://lsa.umich.edu/sweetland/instructors/teaching-resources/using-blogs-in-the-classroom.html)
- [Teaching with Blogs](https://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/teaching-with-blogs/)

Note that WordPress is a common blogging website used at Trinity and all first year students are required to set up and use a blog for their Foundations courses. See this [WordPress Guide](http://create.twu.ca/help/wordpress/basics/wordpress-guide) to set up your own account and get started with blogging!  It can also be used for a course website, rather than have content in Moodle. (We also use [Grav](https://getgrav.org/) as an alternative to WordPress, so please chat with our online team for options that best suit you, your course, and your learners!)

*Questions to Consider:*  

:fa-question: Would you use a blog activity/assessment in your course?  For what purpose?

:fa-question: What are the key challenges for you as the instructor and for your students?
