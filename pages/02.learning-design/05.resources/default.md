## Selecting Course Resources

Once you've confirmed your course learning outcomes and assessment plan (see [Backwards Design](https://multi-access.twu.ca/learning-design/course-planning#Backward_Design)), you're ready to select the resources for your course, including textbooks, articles, videos, graphics, etc.

Here are some questions to consider when choosing a resource:

- Do the topics in the resource address your course learning outcomes and topics?
- Is the resource written at an appropriate level?
- Does it explain concepts clearly?
- Is it up-to-date?
- Does it fit with the student workload? Is there too much to read, or too little? Consider making some sections optional reading.
- Is the resource visually appealing? This may not be high on the priority list, but images, graphic organizers, and the way the chapters are structured are key features to help students learn.
- What features does the resource have to guide students in their learning? (e.g. chapter questions, summary, glossary, case studies, diagrams, etc.). Are there any online features to help students? (e.g. web links, flashcards, study notes, online quizzes, etc.)
- Are there additional resources to support the instructor? (e.g. Instructor’s manual, PowerPoint templates, test banks, chapter notes, etc.)
- How expensive is it? This may seem like a minor point, but many students choose not buy their course texts because they are too pricey.
- And finally, what do others think of this textbook? You may want to read reviews or ask your colleagues who have use it previously.

One final important question...is it accessible?  

See the following checklist from [Accessibility Toolkit](https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/back-matter/appendix-checklist-for-accessibility-toolkit/) - 2nd Edition by BCcampus

### Appendix A: Checklist for Accessibility

**Organizing content**  
☑️ Content is organized under headings and subheadings.  
☑️ Headings and subheadings are used sequentially (e.g., Heading 1, Heading 2).


**Images**  
☑️ Images that convey information include alternative text (alt text) descriptions of the image’s content or function.  
☑️ Graphs, charts, and maps also include contextual or supporting details in the text surrounding the image.  
☑️ Images do not rely on colour to convey information.  
☑️ Images that are purely decorative do not have alt text descriptions. (Descriptive text is unnecessary if the image doesn’t convey contextual content information).

**Links**  
☑️ The link text describes the destination of the link and does not use generic text such as “click here” or “read more.”  
☑️ If a link will open or download a file (like a PDF or Excel file), a textual reference is included in the link information (e.g., [PDF]).  
☑️ Links do not open in new windows or tabs.  
☑️ If a link must open in a new window or tab, a textual reference is included in the link information (e.g., [NewTab]).

**Tables**  
☑️ Tables include row and column headers.  
☑️ Row and column headers have the correct scope assigned.  
☑️ Tables include a caption.  
☑️ Tables avoid merged or split cells.  
☑️ Tables have adequate cell padding.

**Multimedia**  
☑️ A transcript is available for each audio resource including relevant non-speech content. Transcript includes: speaker’s name, all speech content, relevant descriptions of speech, descriptions of relevant non-speech audio, and headings and subheadings.  
☑️ Videos have captions of all speech content and relevant non-speech content.  
☑️ Videos include audio descriptions of contextual visuals (e.g., graphs, charts).

**Formulas**  
☑️ Simple equations use symbols that will be correctly interpreted by screen readers (for example, minus signs and not hyphens).  
☑️ Complex equations are written in MathML or written in such a way they can be translated into MathML (for example, written in LaTeX and rendered with MathJax).  
☑️ Equations are images with alternative text descriptions if MathML is not an option.

**Font size**  
☑️ Font size is 12 point or higher for body text.  
☑️ Font size is 9 point for footnotes or endnotes.  
☑️ Font size can be zoomed to 200%.

## Considerations for Educational Technology

​There is a plethora of tools available to engage students and help meet the learning outcomes of your course. Before deciding which tools to use, ask these questions:
- What are the learning outcomes of the activity/assignment?
- What access do students have?
- Will this tool be a barrier to learning? (e.g. more time spent on tech than learning).
- What support is available for students who use this tool?
- Could students choose their own tool to demonstrate their learning?


In the tabs below are some links to help students and instructors **communicate, collaborate, share, engage and create.**
Also, be sure to check out the tools available through Moodle (e.g. [H5P](https://h5p.org/) is a great one!).

## Evaluating E-Learning Tools
When selecting an e-learning tool, it is important to evaluate its effectiveness and appropriateness.

The Rubric for E-Learning Tool Evaluation from Anstey and Watson offers educators a framework, with criteria and levels of achievement, to assess the suitability of an e-learning tool for their learners' needs and for their own learning outcomes and classroom context.

The following notes are modified from [A Rubric for Evaluating E-Learning Tools in Higher Education](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2018/9/a-rubric-for-evaluating-e-learning-tools-in-higher-education) by Lauren M. Anstey and Gavan P. L. Watson from Western University.

---  

1. **Functionality:** Does the tool serve its intended purpose well?   
- **Scale:** Is the tool flexible in accommodating various class sizes and groups?  
- **Ease of Use:** Is the tool intuitive and easy to use?  
- **Tech Support / Help Availability:** Is there timely support available?  
- **Hypermediality:** Does the tool support and encourage instructors and students to engage with and communicate through different forms of media in a flexible, nonlinear fashion?  

---  

2. **Accessibility:** Does the tool support the Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles of flexible, adaptable curriculum design to support multiple learning approaches and engagement for all students?  
- **User-Focused Participation:** Does the tool address the needs of diverse users and include broader understandings of literacies and student capabilities?  
- **Required Equipment:** Are there environmental factors that impact accessibility, such as necessary hardware (e.g., speakers, a microphone, and a mobile phone) and the technology or service (e.g., high-speed internet connection) that users need to engage with an e-learning tool?  
- **Cost of Use:** What are the financial costs of the tool?  

---  

3. **Technical:** What basic technologies are needed to make the tool work?  
- **Integration/Embedding within a Learning Management System (LMS).** Does the tool "play well" with an institution's LMS? (Moodle)  
- **Desktop/Laptop Operating Systems and Browser:** Can learners effectively use the e-learning tool on a desktop or laptop computer if they have a standard, up-to-date operating system (OS) and/or browser?  
- **Additional Downloads:** Does the tool require learners to install additional software or browser plug-ins?  

---  

4. **Mobile Design**  
- **Access:** Can students access and interact with the tool either through the download of an application ("app") built for their OS or through the browser?  
- **Functionality:** Are there differences between the mobile version and the desktop version?  
- **Offline Access:** Does the tool offer an offline mode to expand access for those who have limited or intermittent connectivity?  

---  

5. **Privacy, Data Protection, and Rights**  
- **Sign Up / Sign In.** Does the tool ask students to create an account, requiring personal information?  
- **Data Privacy and Ownership.** Does the tool claim ownership of the work that is residing on their
servers, or make their content publicly available by default?   
- **Archiving, Saving, and Exporting Data.** Does the tool help guard against data loss through export and backup while also offering learners the flexibility to freely move their content between tools rather than being locked
into or committed to one tool?  

---  

!!!! The final three categories of the rubric stem from the [Communities of Inquiry (CoI) model](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2018/9/a-rubric-for-evaluating-e-learning-tools-in-higher-education#fn14) which considers, in part, how the design of online learning environments might best create and sustain a sense of community among learners.

6. **Social Presence:** Does the tool help establish a safe, trusting environment that fosters
collaboration, teamwork, and an overall sense of community?
- **Collaboration:** Does the tool provide students opportunities to interact with their peers and
collaborate on activities to build a sense of community?
- **User Accountability:** Does the tool provide a safe and trusted environment?  
- **Diffusion:** Is it a commonly used tools, allowing students to feel comfortable
with and positive about using it, thus contributing to regular use, endorsement,
and sense of belonging?

---  

7. **Teaching Presence:** Does the tool enable instructors to establish and maintain their teaching presence through
facilitation, customization, and feedback?  
- **Facilitation:** Does the tool provide easy-to-use features that enhance
an instructor's ability to effectively engage in facilitation activities?  
- **Customization:** Does the tool allow for flexibility and customization, supporting
instructors in communicating alignment of learning outcomes — making it clear to students why
they are doing what they are doing?    
- **Learning Analytics:** Does the tool assess the availability, quality, and
user-friendliness of the analytics offered to ensure the tool supports the
desired data required for tracking performance, providing feedback on learning,
and informing course design?  

---  

8. **Cognitive Presence:** Does the tool support students' cognitive engagement in learning tasks.
- **Enhancement of Cognitive Task(s).** Does the tool enhance or
transform learning by modifying or redefining engagement in the targeted task, either by redesigning the activity
or by establishing new approaches previously inconceivable or unachievable
through other means?    
- **Higher-Order Thinking:** Does the tool help learners integrate, rearrange, or extend new and existing information to achieve a purpose or find answers to a complex problem?  
- **Metacognitive Engagement:** Does the tool prompt understanding, regulation, and reflection of students' own cognitive activities across the learning process?
