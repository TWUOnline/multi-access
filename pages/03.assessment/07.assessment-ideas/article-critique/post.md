Here is a sample of an Article Analysis assignment:

!!! An objective of this course is for students to engage in reflective thought regarding the integration of biological psychology with their own Christian spiritual understanding (if you are not a Christian, write from your faith, religious, or worldview perspective).  
!!! The assignment is designed to assess the evolution of your ideas and thought processes throughout the course as you learn more about the brain and behaviour.  
!!! For this assignment, you will be provided with a reading and asked to submit a 2-page, double-spaced, written analysis of the reading. Additional thought questions designed to stimulate your thinking will also be provided.

!!! **Questions to ask when Analyzing an Article**  
!!! Consider these questions when analyzing an article:     
!!! 1. Who were the participants and how many were there? What level(s) of analysis (biological, psychological, environmental) are being employed in this study/review? Explain and identify the specific details of the study that show this. 
!!! 2. How was this study/review conducted? Was it an experiment or a non-experiment? How can you tell? What were the variables under investigation in this study? Identify the dependent and independent variables, if applicable.
!!! 3. In light of the participants and methodology, in your opinion, how influential is this article? 
!!! 4. How would you apply your faith/religious perspective and interact with the main findings of the article (i.e., how can the findings be interpreted from your faith/religious perspective?). What are some possible real-world implications of these findings for people in general?

!!!! Don't forget to use the writing resources available to you, such as the [TWU Writing Centre](https://www.twu.ca/learning-commons/writing-centre), the Writing Tips located in the Assessment section of this course, and other APA resources (e.g. [Purdue Online Writing Lab](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html))
