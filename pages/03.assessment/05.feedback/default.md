# Giving Feedback in Online Courses

We often think of creating a feedback form or grading rubric simply to help with the marking process.  Remember that these can be great tools to share with students **before** they start working on the assignment.

A detailed grading rubric, for example, can help students with the following:
1. *Understand the assignment:* Rubrics can help explain an assessment by detailing exactly what you’re looking for and how you will assess their work.
1. *Focus on the goals:* Explain how the assessment in intended to demonstrate their understanding of specific learning outcomes.
1. *Plan their time and effort:* By seeing the weight of categories on the rubric, they can prioritize their presentation of their learning (e.g. reflection part of the paper is worth 20%, whereas analysis is worth 30%).


## Types of Feedback
Consider the various ways to assess (tests, papers, projects, presentations, graphics, etc.) and how the grading criteria and feedback may differ.  Below we'll highlight some common and effective ways to give students feedback.

Here is a quick snapshot:

! - A checklist is an assessment tool that is used to grade students based on the presence or absence of knowledge, behaviours, and skills. Checklists itemize the tasks you want students to do.  
! - An analytic rubric is a way to break down specific parts of your assignment. It provides a scale of performance for you to measure your students’ achievement. This is a more detailed approach to grading and provides a clear picture of your expectations for an assignment.  
! - A holistic rubric is simpler than an analytic rubric. Generally, it has 3 – 5 levels of performance (score) and a description that defines how students will achieve the grade for each level. Holistic rubrics look at the entire assignment and grades it on a single scale.  
! - Audio feedback allows you to record your verbal comments on students work.  
! - Video feedback can include screen capture so you can explain your comments visually.  


## Checklists
A checklist can be used to assess whether learners have included the elements you have prescribed.  

Checklist Sample: Discussion Criteria
-------------------
| **Criteria**                                                                                                                                                       | **Weighting** |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Evidence of having reviewed all readings and comprehensiveness of responses to questions                                                                           | /2            |
| Demonstration of your ability to use critical thinking and self-reflection in discussing thoughts and feelings about the course material and the course in general | /2            |
| Integration of your views of the readings with your own experiences, biases, and knowledge of social work practice                                                 | /2            |
| Demonstration of your ability to communicate your ideas in writing and to organize your responses clearly, thoroughly, and concisely                               | /2            |
| Learner has responded to others’ posts in the Discussions area. Responses are thoughtful and insightful and promote the learning of fellow students.               | /2            |


### Analytic Rubrics
An analytic rubric contains the list of criteria that highlights the what the learner is expected to do or demonstrate. Along with the criteria, a rubric provides examples of what is expected at each level of performance, from poor to excellent. Providing this criteria up front to learners allows them to assess their progress and compare to a performance level.

Below are some examples of rubric use in our online courses.

*Grading Criteria*

| **Criteria**                              | 0–1 marks                                                                              | 2-3 marks                                                                                     | 4-5 marks                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Quality of posting**                    | Minor evidence that course readings were done and student understands discussion topic | Evidence that most of course readings done and student has some knowledge of discussion topic | Sound evidence that student has done course readings and has a thorough knowledge of discussion topic |
| **Communication skills**                  | Postings are too short/long and/or unclear and hard to understand                      | Postings are usually, but not always clear, concise and easy to understand                    | Postings are clear, concise and easy to understand                                                    |
| **Critical thinking and self-reflection** | Minor evidence of critical thought and reflection on others’ and own postings          | Some evidence of critical thought and self-reflection on others’ and own postings             | Exceptionally well- supported, thoughtful, insightful comments made on others’ and own postings       |
| **Participation**                         | Rarely interacts or responds to other members of online community                      | Interacts now and then with other members of online community                                 | Regularly participates in, and facilitates interaction among members of online community              |


You'll notice the last two in particular have a detailed range of "Needs Improvement" to "Exceeds Expectations".  If possible, try to work out the details of what you're looking for at each level of mastery. This helps not only when you're grading students' work, but also when you need to explain the grade you gave.

There are different opinions about using detailed, or standardized rubrics.  See the following comments:
!!! Rubrics are a popular tool to use in grading online assignments. Some think they are a great way to standardize the grading process, while others think they are a way to stifle individual thinking in learners. This difference in opinion probably stems from the fact that some courses may need a more standardized approach, while others may need a more open-ended approach. Standardized rubrics can be seen as a more fair approach to grading by some learners that gives them a specific road-map for every part of an assignment. On the other hand, more open rubrics can save time and headaches, while allowing your learners to have some freedom and flexibility in their learning.
The most common way to design standardized rubrics is to have extensive details on each line of the rubric explaining what each point counts for, with several rows of criteria covering every aspect of each assignment:

|                       | **Does Not Meet Expectations (1 mark)**                                                    | **Meets Expectations**  **(2 marks)**                                                                  | **Exceeds expectations**  **(3 marks)**                                           |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Comprehensiveness** | Provides incomplete responses for some questions                                           | Provides responses for all questions                                                                   | Provides detailed responses for all questions                                     |
| **Understanding**     | Responses lack clarity, accuracy and/or precision                                          | Mostly clear, precise and accurate responses                                                           | Clear, precise and accurate responses                                             |
| **Application**       | Fails to convincingly apply knowledge and theory to new contexts                           | Applies knowledge and theory to new contexts well                                                      | Applies knowledge and theory to new contexts with superior skill                  |
| **Technical Merit**   | Several spelling or grammatical errors. Sentences and paragraphs are not well-constructed. | Minor and/or few spelling or grammatical errors. Sentences and paragraphs are mostly well-constructed. | Spelling and grammar are accurate. Sentences and paragraphs are well-constructed. |


!!! This method creates a strict roadmap that helps many learners. However, it also rarely allows learners to wrestle with what they want to do for an assignment. Additionally, there are many gaps that learners could fall into between point values or descriptions. These issues may not apply to all assignments, so you may find that a standardized rubric works best for your course design. Just keep in mind that these can be more time consuming to create and utilize from the instructor viewpoint.

### Holistic Rubrics
A simpler approach to rubrics is to make it open-ended, or standardized.
Here's an explanation to compare:
!!! Another way to approach grading issues is to take a more flexible, open-ended approach to creating rubrics. For example, try to have fewer rows that focus more on learners showing their knowledge than focusing on various assignment details like word count or assignment formats. Simply give the general area that will be graded, the parameters that you will look for, and a total number of points possible. Then leave an open slot for you to enter the points they earn in that area and a place for you to explain why you gave those points. For example:

| **Subject Knowledge** | Subject knowledge is evident throughout the project. All information is clear, appropriate, and correct. | **20** | (comment) | (points earned) |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-----------|-----------------|


!!! This format can help you look at grading as more of a conversation than a final decree, especially if you allow learners to turn in early versions of assignments for formative feedback. However, keep in mind that learners may not be accustomed to this more open-ended approach, so you may cause anxiety if you do not scaffold them into this less structured approach.

### Sample Holistic Grading Criteria

|Emerging|Developing|Proficient|Extending|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|The student demonstrates an initial understanding of the concepts and competencies relevant to the expected learning.|The student demonstrates a partial understanding of the concepts and competencies relevant to the expected learning.|The student demonstrates a complete understanding of the concepts and competencies relevant to the expected learning.|The student demonstrates a sophisticated understanding of the concepts and competencies relevant to the expected learning.|



### One Point Rubrics




### Peer Feedback
One last important topic to cover in our assessment unit is about the value of peer feedback.
Peer assessment can:
- improve student work/performance
- offer timely feedback
- reduce grading workload
- help make your grading criteria more clear (as students use it to evaluate their peers)
- allow for critical reflection (of students' own work & their peers)

To this last point, consider as well asking students to self-evaluate their work, acknowledging feedback from peers and/or the instructor and setting goals for improvement.
