<h3>Dialog Cards</h3>

<p>This is a very robust resource that can be used in a variety of ways in a course to support student learning. Most commonly, instructors will use this to help students learn key terminology. This tool, however, can be modified to provide extensive support regardless of the subject matter. The examples below provide a sense of some of the modifications that can be integrated into a course:

<h3>Documentation Tool</h3>

<p>This tool can be used to help students record their thoughts. Many instructors find it helpful for students as it allows them to ask guiding questions or rhetorical questions during a Learning Lab session. Students can then document their thoughts and export their responses for future reference in the course. The example below highlights an effective way this tool can be used:

<h3>Interactive Video</h3>

<p>The Interactive Video tool in H5P is helpful for instructors who like to integrate videos into their courses. This tool allows instructors to add multiple choice and fill in the blank questions, pop-up text and other types of interactions to their videos. This can be used with most video streaming sources such as <i>Microsoft Stream, YouTube, TedTalks, Vimeo,</i> and more. The example below shows how this tool was used to create a formative assessment for students so that they could better gauge how well they learned the content in the video.</p>

<h3>Interactive Book</h3>

<p>This tool provides a creative way to embed some of the other tools (introduced above) into content in the course to help support student learning. The example below demonstrates how this tool allows an instructor to utilize various assessments methods within each page of the "book" so that students can receive feedback about their learning. This is most effective in helping students prepare for a graded assignment.

<h3>Course Presentation</h3>

<p>The Course Presentation tool in H5P can be used to create an interactive presentation that allows instructors to integrate some of the features explored above. In this example below, you can see how text and videos can be integrated into a presentation. Additionally, a formative assessment has been integrated (at the end of the presentation) that helps students assess how well they understood the content from the presentation.</p>
