### Essays, Projects, & Interviews

If you use essays, projects, and interviews in your courses, what are some techniques you use to aid students, or some common problems? What adjustments do you foresee for an online course?  
Here are some questions to consider:

- What does the 'drafting stage' look like for these projects?  Do you give formative feedback to students before they hand in their final project?
- What online tools can students use? (e.g. Google docs to collaborate, Zoom for presentations, etc.)
- How do I prevent cheating and plagiarism in student writing?
