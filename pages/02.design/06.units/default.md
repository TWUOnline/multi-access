### Setting the Stage

Imagine you're driving to the TWU Langley campus, reviewing in your head the lecture you're about to give your class.  It's on a topic you are stoked about - and you hope your students will understand the concepts and be inspired by the lesson.

You go over your opening: First, a welcome message to students, talk a bit about the previous lesson, perhaps some comments on a recent assignment submission.  And then, you introduce the topic.

How will you hook your learners so they stay motivated and engaged? Start with a story? A metaphor? Bring in a current event?  Play a video clip or song?

When describing what you'll go over in the lecture, what key points will you give them a preview of?  How will you summarize the topics in a way that learners are intrigued and want to know more?

Now, imagine you had to do this online...asynchronously.

### Unit Writing

When we write our units, we first consider our online learners. They may be sitting at a desk, after a long day of work/studies/  They have 2 hours to study tonight.  As they click on "Unit 1"...what do they see and read that will interest them in the topic?  How will they know what the unit is about and what activities they need to complete?

Our units typically follow a structure that allows for students to engage with the lesson, plan their time, and prepare for assignments.

See the details of the course unit template below, as well as [TWU Unit Template - ONLINE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XdNGUPgpYB_IKALdL7cEpwY5NH0z_ywqwxj4G-8rwYY/edit?usp=sharing) Google doc for you to copy.

Let's explore our next topic on...

[ui-accordion-item title="Learning Activities"]

#### Activity 1.2: Case Study
Read the following case study and consider what you would do in the situation.
What ethical issues arise?

! As a manager, you discover that one of your employees is on Facebook during the workday. Whether it is a quick check for messages or spending minutes reading the news feed, this constitutes stealing from the company.  What should you do as a manager and why? What perspectives should you consider and why? For example, consider how your response to this situation may vary depending upon whether you think moral value is objectively true or only subjectively true. What are the consequences of the actions you feel you must take?

!!! ***Design Note:*** Case studies are great application activities.  Consider the lesson content and how it is applied in a ‘real world’ situation.

*Note that you may be asked to review this case or similar cases in your class discussion groups. You may want to prepare by relating the case to your readings. Specifically, identify the ethical issues and terms to help explain the case.*

!!!!! Note to students where they might do activities in a zoom class or a learning lab.

Match the following terms to their correct definition.
1.	Term – definition…
2.	Term – definition…
3.	Term – definition…

!!! ***Design Note:*** If learners need to memorize vocabulary in your course, whether for exams, quizzes , or other assignments, you may want to provide an opportunity for them to practice and identify what needs further study.  Quizzes can be multiple choice, matching, true-false, or short answer.  

!!! ***Design Note:*** We often use H5P in our courses for vocabulary practice.  Check out some [H5P examples](https://create.twu.ca/h5p/), or see the assessment section for more ideas.
