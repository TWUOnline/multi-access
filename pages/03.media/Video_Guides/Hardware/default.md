## Hardware Recommendations for Video Conferencing


The following lists are intended to help you decide what computer hardware will best suit your video conferencing needs within a multi-access classroom environment.

###Computers
Based on the recommended specs provided by [Zoom](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/204003179-System-Requirements-for-Zoom-Rooms), we recommend the following:
-	2.5Ghz Dual Core Intel Core i5 (or higher) Processor
- 4GB (or higher) Ram

###Webcams
It is recommended that your webcam (built-in or external) be capable of capturing at least [1080p resolution] (https://www.lifewire.com/what-the-term-1080p-means-1846837). Most laptops have a built-in webcam that is 1080p capable, although some cheaper models do not. If you are using an older (but still capable) laptop, you might want to consider upgrading to an external webcam. If you are using a desktop, you will need an external webcam.

###Microphones
The sound quality of a built-in mic is often not desirable due to the proximity to other computer hardware (i.e. computer fans). For this reason, we strongly recommend using an external mic. There are many options to choose from.
