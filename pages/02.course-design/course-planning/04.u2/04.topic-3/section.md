## Topic 3: Ensuring Quality in Online Learning Design

What is a *quality online course*?  Take a moment to jot down some thoughts.


When we assess the quality of an online course, many course designers turn to the **[Quality Matters rubric for Higher Education](https://www.qualitymatters.org/sites/default/files/PDFs/StandardsfromtheQMHigherEducationRubric.pdf)**.  Have a quick look at the link and we'll expand on the elements in a bit.  As you skim the sections, pay attention to the key feature of alignment.

! "Unique to the QM Rubric is the concept of Alignment. This occurs when critical course components — Learning Objectives (Competencies) (2.1, 2.2), Assessment and Measurement (3.1), Instructional Materials (4.1), Learning Activities and Learner Interaction (5.1), and Course Technology (6.1) — work together to ensure students achieve desired learning outcomes." - *From [QM Course Design Rubric Standards](https://www.qualitymatters.org/qa-resources/rubric-standards/higher-ed-rubric)*.

At TWU, we have slightly modified the rubric to align with our own Trinity standards of values for teaching and learning.

As you read the following guidelines, consider how you can incorporate them into your course design.

---
### #1: Course Overview and Introduction
•	Instructions are clear on how to navigate the course and how to get started.

•	The Course Overview provides a course description, learning outcomes, and list of assessments.

•	There is a self-introduction by the instructor, welcoming students to the course and explaining key aspects of what to expect in the course.

•	Learners are asked to introduce themselves to the class.

---
### #2: Learning Outcomes
•	The course learning outcomes are measurable and reflect the course description and level of the course.

•	The module/unit learning outcomes are measurable and consistent with the course-level outcomes.

•	The learning outcomes are stated clearly and written from the learner’s perspective.

•	There is a clear relationship between the course/unit learning outcomes, learning activities, and assessments.

---
### #3: Assessment
•	The assessments measure the achievement of the course learning outcomes and are consistent with course activities and resources.

•	Specific and descriptive criteria (rubrics, marking schemes) are provided for the evaluation of students’ work and participation.

•	The assessments are sequenced, varied, flexible, and appropriate to the content being assessed.

•	Sufficient and varied opportunities for formative feedback are provided.

•	The learner workload is appropriate and reasonable for the level and number of credits for the course.

---
### #4: Instructional Materials
•	The instructional materials (written/oral content, videos, graphics, readings, etc.), support learners in achieving the learning outcomes.

•	Course materials and resources are up-to-date, relevant, and appropriate for the level of the course.

•	The instructional materials are free of bias, culturally inclusive, and provide flexibility and choice.

•	A variety of instructional materials are used in the course.

---
### #5: Learning Activities and Learner  Interaction
•	Learning activities support learners in achieving the learning outcomes and completing assessments.
•	Learning activities provide scaffolding opportunities for building foundational knowledge and skills within the course.

•	Learning activities foster student-instructor, student-content, and if appropriate to the course, student-student interaction.

•	The requirements for learner interaction are clearly stated.

---
### #6: Course Technology
•	The technology used in the course support the learning outcomes, activities and assessments.

•	Tools promote student engagement and active learning.

•	Students are instructed on how to protect their data and privacy.

•	All third-party materials are identified, cited and permission requested if necessary.

•	A variety of technology is used in the course.

---
### #7: Learner Support
•	Instructions for accessing support (instructor, IT, library, student services), are clearly stated in the course overview and when appropriate, throughout the course.

•	Instructors provide support for students throughout the course (e.g. though emails, assessment feedback, welcome videos, weekly debriefing, and other updates).

•	Learners are able to participate in a peer support forum (e.g. Learning Café), for course-related questions or community-building activities.

---
### #8: Accessibility and Usability
•	The course navigation facilitates ease of use.

•	The overall course is structured in a logical, consistent, sequenced, and efficient manner.

•	Instructions are clear, include rationale for activities and assessments, and provide seamless connections between the various elements in the course.

•	The course provides accessible text, videos and images for diverse learners.

---
### #9: TWU Values and Standards
•	Learner interaction (student-instructor, student-student, student-content) promotes a sense of community aligned with Trinity Western University core values.

•	Course design and instructional materials meet academic standards for Higher Education (online) learning.
