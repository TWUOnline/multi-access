#### Activity 2.3: Starting a Course Blueprint

:fa-book: Read section 12.9 [Step seven: design course structure and learning activities](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/chapter/11-9-step-seven/) from our course text.

:fa-pencil: Take a couple minutes to download the TWU course blueprint template (Google doc or Word version).  Start mapping out a course you need to plan.  Even if it's just to add the course description and course learning outcomes - it's a start!  This blueprint process usually takes some time and contemplation, especially figuring out the unit learning outcomes and resources.
