# Course Formats at TWU

There are several course formatting options available to TWU faculty. Below we will share some examples and highlights of pros and cons.  Of utmost importance is the student experience of online learning, as the format should remove barriers to learning, ease navigation and presentation of learning materials, and facilitate engagement between learner, instructors, and the course content.

## Moodle
Most Trinity online courses have traditionally been developed in Moodle.  If you choose Moodle for your course format, please consider integrating best practices for online teaching and learning.  Here are some quick tips with a focus on formatting:

#### Setting up your tabs in Moodle
Here is a possible layout for tab topics, with suggested details to include:
1. Home page
   - welcome message from instructors
   - details of the course
      - course description, learning outcomes, assessment, Resources
   - instructions on navigation
   - support links for students (e.g. [STUDENT GUIDE TO ONLINE LEARNING](https://www.twu.ca/online-learning))
   - Announcement forum
   - pdf of syllabus
2. Course Schedule
   - includes due dates for assessments, weekly topics, etc.
3. Course Units (weekly topics)
   - Unit Overview
   - Unit topics
   - Learning activities
   - Assessment
4. Assessment
   - Optional tab that has all assessment info and dropboxes in one area.

## GitHub
Our Online Team uses Github for some programs, as it has the following advantages:
- it embeds into Moodle, so students experience similar navigation
- it allows for edits to multiple sections (e.g. a broken link in a course can be edited in one place, and apply to all sections of that course)
- it promotes course fidelity. Some programs emphasize consistency in their course resources, units, assessments, etc. This allows for multiple instructors to use the same material, while still allowing for personalized teaching styles.

### Sections Format in Moodle (using GitHub)
Our default is to use the sections format, which has tabs at the left-hand side, an Activity Checklist, and other  features that ease navigation.


### Pages Format in Moodle (using GitHub)
Another format we provide through GitHub in Moodle separates topics and activities into separate pages.  This allows instructors to hide or show activities.  

!! Note that any modification to content  (sections or pages format) needs to be edited in GitHub.  Typically our online team handles all of these requests.  Email elearning@twu.ca for support, or create a [Bug Report](https://github.com/TWUOnline/bug-tracking/issues/new?assignees=cmadland%2C+kmarjanovic%2C+MeeksonHundoo&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) to notify our team of an issue to correct.  Alternatively, contact Colin Madland for an orientation to learn how to edit in GitHub.

## WordPress
