## Considerations for Educational Graphics

It should be noted that visual aids, such as graphic organizers, pictures, maps, etc., not only convey information in a different format, but also have the ability to motivate and inspire learners.

**Benefits of utilizing graphics include:**

1. Keep learners' attention
2. Activation of prior knowledge
3. Helps learners develop mental models
4. Facilitates transfer of learning
5. Keeps learners engaged

Here are some things to consider when creating educational graphics.

- **Does the photo fill a purpose?**

**A picture isn't clear enough, what about an infographic?**
When using visual data, charts, and statistics, infographics provide an easy way for people to digest information. Information can be transformed into graphics that are memorable, attention-grabbing, and even persuasive by using the right combination of color, proportion, and negative space.

- **Is it helpful?**Â If your students have difficulty grasping key concepts in class, graphics can help by helping them understand them. Think about this before you begin creating them for your course. Infographics are useful for explaining complex ideas. An icon or image can be used to better represent processes that require a lot of text to describe. You should ensure the graphic addresses a specific problem before including it in the course materials, as meaningless graphics can distract from the content.
