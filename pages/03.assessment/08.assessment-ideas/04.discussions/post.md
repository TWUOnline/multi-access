Discussion forums are a popular form of assessment for online courses.  Which means, if students are taking several online courses at once...there is a certain amount of *forum fatigue* they may experience!  Be sure to craft your discussion questions in a way that meets the unit learning outcomes, but also inspires collaboration, inquiry, and critical thinking.

Listed below, there are various activity types you can have in discussion forums:

1. **Web Field Trips**: Instructor provides a link or a series of links. Students follow the link(s) and report back through an instructor-defined set of questions.
1. **Brainstorming**: Students set forth a series of ideas on a given topic without evaluation.
1. **Problem-Solving**: Small groups work out a solution to a problem.
1. **Writing Groups**: Students work together in groups of four or five to share drafts and provide peer response and peer-editing.
1. **Case Analysis**: Students work independent on a common case followed by group analysis in the board.
1. **Collaborative Writing**: Workgroups work together to create a single document – proposals and analytical reports work well – which they then post to the larger group for critique.
1. **Cooperative Debate**: Workgroups present perspectives on a particular issue, followed by a whole group consensus-building discussion.
1. **Discussions of Course Readings**: Instructor creates threaded discussions
around assigned readings. Threads may include pre-reading (anticipation) activities, interpretations, evaluations, etc.
1. **Research Bank**: Students and instructor contribute links and citations to a common area for a classwide research topic.
