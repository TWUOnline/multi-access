## High Impact Teaching Practices

So how do we teach online effectively?  What techniques make a difference for learners in terms of their success and overall experience in the course? 

Here are 5 key engagement strategies, or High-Impact Teaching Practices (HITPs):

1. Change students’ view of learning Help students 
   - Help students become meta-learners, discover self-motivations for learning, realize how learning works, and  develop effective learning practices (From [MetaLearning: Growing Self-Directed Learners](https://www.oakland.edu/Assets/upload/docs/CETL/ConferencePresentationMaterials2014/StephenCarroll/Metalearning-Slides.pdf))
2. Use learning-centered course design
   - Use [Backward Design](https://multi-access.twu.ca/learning-design/backward-design): First, identify Learning outcomes, next decide assessment, and finally select learning activities.
3. Use small groups in a powerful way
   - e.g. “Team-Based Learning” (TBL) procedures involve group formation, appropriate assignments for groups, creating individual and group accountability, and prompt feedback)
4. Engage students in service-learning/community engagement—with reflection
   - Students engage in meaningful and challenging situations, putting theory into practice in real-world situations and reflecting on the experience.
5. Be a leader with your students
   - Show you care, motivate students, celebrate achievement, and be trustworthy.
