### Video & Audio Assignments

How do you currently integrate technology/media into your assignments?  Is there an opportunity for personalization or creativity in the way information is presented?  Let's discuss utilizing media in your assignments, such as video and audio applications.

**Video Assessments**

Most students have access to a video recording device (their cell phones), so why not take advantage of that! Consider how you might use video assessments in your course. Students can record a video blog, give a presentation, show their field trip, demonstrate a procedure...the list goes on. Storytelling is a key feature of video assignments, so consider how students can connect the course content to their own personal or professional experience. Another way to use videos is for students to analyze videos online related to your course.

**Podcasts**
Podcasts can be another engaging alternative/addition to a typical essay, project, interview or presentation.  See the following sample assignment from a TWU course, as well as the resources in the learning activity below.

#### Learning Activity: Podcast

In this learning activity, you will create an idea for an action research project based on one of the practical problems you have identified from your professional life. You will present this project idea in a podcast for your colleagues. Audio I and Audio II in the Digital Literacy section of the orientation will explain how to set up your podcast. You can find the link to the orientation [here.](https://create.twu.ca/orientation/#Digital_Literacy)

If you know how to create video you are welcome to do that instead. It is your choice whether to create a podcast or video. This learning activity is intended to be informal, so do not spend too much time planning and researching your topic. Please note that if you are sharing confidential information from your place of employment that you should change the name of your employer or any people involved.

##### Instructions:

*   Using one of the practical problems you identified from learning activity 8.1, create an idea for an action research project following the steps described by Plano-Clark and Creswell (2015) on pp. 440-442.
*   Record that idea in a podcast so that it can be presented to your colleagues for feedback.
*   Your introduction should include your key problem and explain the structure of your presentation.
*   Your project idea should relate to a practical leadership issue you are currently facing.
*   Your project idea should be clear and well organized.
*   Your project should fit within 3-5 minutes but no more than 6 minutes.
*   Provide a conclusion that gives a call to action.
*   Upload your podcast to [soundcloud.com](https://soundcloud.com), [tapewrite.com](https://tapewrite.com), or another suitable online service and embed it in a new post on the Unit 8 discussion forum.

**Reminder:** Make sure you take some time to practice what you are going to say (I highly recommend creating a script) and give yourself lots of time to record, make mistakes, re-record, make more mistakes, take a break, re-record and then post it on the discussion forum.

*   Note this podcast is part of your assessment for this unit.
