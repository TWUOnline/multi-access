When we ask learners to engage with course resources, how do we set them up for success?  There are several [High Impact Practices (HIPS)](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/support/integrative-learning/high-impact-practices-hips-or-engaged-learning-practices) that we suggest when introducing a student to a textbook chapter, article, or video.  

When introducing a reading/video, consider adding the following:
- Who is the author/speaker?  Why are they an expert in the field?
- What is the resource about? What topics will the text/video cover?
- Why is this important?  How does it relate to the course/unit learning outcomes?  How does it impact the field of study?  How could it affect the learner?
- How much time will it take?  How long will it take to read/watch?

After students have viewed the resource, what should they do?!  If we consider active learning in an online course, what does this look like when students read a chapter or watch a video?  
- **Reflect!** Add a "Questions to Consider" after the resource is presented.  What key questions should students reflect on.  Ask them to jot down notes in a reflective journal.
- **Go!** Does this reading/video support a field trip or observation?  For example, in a Worship Arts course at Trinity, students are asked to analyze their church's worship service. After they read an article, they can participate in a church service and apply the principles they learned.  Other courses ask students to get outside and consider environmental considerations, workplace interactions, school settings, etc.  The main idea is to apply what students have read/watched to a situation.
- **Ask!** At times we ask students to ask a co-worker, friend, family member about a course concept.  Talking about a resource/concept helps solidify ideas and presents students the opportunity not only to summarize content, but also learn from others about their experiences related to the course content.  
!! When suggesting ungraded interviews, remember to follow ethical practices. We instruct students to disclose the course, the purpose (e.g. general feedback), and place the info will be held (e.g. just conversation between coworkers, or used in an online discussion forum or assignment). If information from interviews is presented online, we encourage students to use pseudonyms.   
- **Do!** After students have engaged with a resource, you may want to ask them to do something!
  - create a graphic organizer comparing ideas
  - create a mind map connecting ideas
  - create a 3D model of what was presented ()
This includes will support students as they interact with these resources.
high-impact practices help students engage in "deep approaches" to learning which are important because "students who use these approaches tend to earn higher grades and retain, integrate, and transfer information at higher rates” (Kuh, 2008).

But what makes a practice “high impact”?

Characteristics of a High Quality, High Impact Practice
Below are eight characteristics (Kuh, 2013) which when incorporated into different academic practices, can engage students and have a high impact on their learning. Beside each characteristic we’ve linked to a teaching story that illustrates the use of a particular characteristic, as well as “friendly contacts” from across campus who are willing to share their experiences with particular high impact characteristics and practices.

- Encourage students to invest significant and meaningful  time and effort on authentic, complex tasks over an extended period of time

See Christine Moresoli’s Teaching Story
Friendly contacts: Gord Stubley and Shannon Dea
Add meaningful interactions amongst students and between  faculty and students about  substantive matters

See Katie Misener’s Teaching Story
Friendly contacts: Regina Vera-Quinn and Shannon Dea
Challenge students’ ways of thinking, increase interactions with individuals with experiences and life experiences different from their own,  Experiences with diversity

See Joseph Sanderson’s Teaching Story
Friendly contacts: Maud Gorbet, Regina Vera-Quinn, John Fedy and Alannah Robinson
Provide frequent, timely and constructive feedback

See Fiona Dunbar’s Teaching Story
Friendly contacts: Anne Fannon, John Fedy and Alannah Robinson
Increase periodic, structured opportunities to reflect and integrate learning

See Geoff Malleck’s Teaching Story
Friendly contacts: Katherine Lithgow, Anne Fannon, Geoff Malleck, and Alannah Robinson
Provide opportunities to discover relevance of learning through real-world applications, or add a real-world/authentic experience

See Laura Johnson’s Teaching Story
Friendly contacts: Gord Stubley, Mary Power and Anne Fannon
Add a public demonstration of competence
