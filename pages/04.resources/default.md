# Resources for Online Courses

[ui-tabs position="top-left" active="0" theme="lite"]

Finding resources for your course can take a lot of time and effort.  A textbook may not explain each course topic, so the search for supplemental resources is crucial.  Below are some tips for choosing a textbook, selecting an Open Resource (OER), and finding supplemental resources (videos, podcasts, images, etc.)

## Selecting Course Resources

Here are some questions to consider when choosing a resource:

- Do the topics in the resource address your course learning outcomes and topics?
- Is the resource written at an appropriate level?
- Does it explain concepts clearly?
- Is it up-to-date?
- Does it fit with the student workload? Is there too much to read, or too little? Consider making some sections optional reading.
- Is the resource visually appealing? This may not be high on the priority list, but images, graphic organizers, and the way the chapters are structured are key features to help students learn.
- What features does the resource have to guide students in their learning? (e.g. chapter questions, summary, glossary, case studies, diagrams, etc.). Are there any online features to help students? (e.g. web links, flashcards, study notes, online quizzes, etc.)
- Are there additional resources to support the instructor? (e.g. Instructor’s manual, PowerPoint templates, test banks, chapter notes, etc.)
- How expensive is it? This may seem like a minor point, but many students choose not buy their course texts because they are too pricey.
- And finally, what do others think of this textbook? You may want to read reviews or ask your colleagues who have use it previously.

One final important question...is it accessible?  

See the following checklist from [Accessibility Toolkit](https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/back-matter/appendix-checklist-for-accessibility-toolkit/) - 2nd Edition by BCcampus

### Appendix A: Checklist for Accessibility

**Organizing content**

☑️ Content is organized under headings and subheadings.

☑️ Headings and subheadings are used sequentially (e.g., Heading 1, Heading 2).


**Images**

☑️ Images that convey information include alternative text (alt text) descriptions of the image’s content or function.

☑️ Graphs, charts, and maps also include contextual or supporting details in the text surrounding the image.

☑️ Images do not rely on colour to convey information.

☑️ Images that are purely decorative do not have alt text descriptions. (Descriptive text is unnecessary if the image doesn’t convey contextual content information).

**Links**

☑️ The link text describes the destination of the link and does not use generic text such as “click here” or “read more.”

☑️ If a link will open or download a file (like a PDF or Excel file), a textual reference is included in the link information (e.g., [PDF]).

☑️ Links do not open in new windows or tabs.

☑️ If a link must open in a new window or tab, a textual reference is included in the link information (e.g., [NewTab]).

**Tables**

☑️ Tables include row and column headers.

☑️ Row and column headers have the correct scope assigned.

☑️ Tables include a caption.

☑️ Tables avoid merged or split cells.

☑️ Tables have adequate cell padding.

**Multimedia**

☑️ A transcript is available for each audio resource including relevant non-speech content. Transcript includes: speaker’s name, all speech content, relevant descriptions of speech, descriptions of relevant non-speech audio, and headings and subheadings.

☑️ Videos have captions of all speech content and relevant non-speech content.

☑️ Videos include audio descriptions of contextual visuals (e.g., graphs, charts).

**Formulas**

☑️ Simple equations use symbols that will be correctly interpreted by screen readers (for example, minus signs and not hyphens).

☑️ Complex equations are written in MathML or written in such a way they can be translated into MathML (for example, written in LaTeX and rendered with MathJax).

☑️ Equations are images with alternative text descriptions if MathML is not an option.

**Font size**

☑️ Font size is 12 point or higher for body text.

☑️ Font size is 9 point for footnotes or endnotes.

☑️ Font size can be zoomed to 200%.
