## Course Design Process at TWU
Every course is different, and every course design experience is different.  In this section we'd like to briefly share a typical process we follow in creating and revising our online courses at TWU.

*Please note: This process may not apply to your course! Often with time constraints, we speed things up to make sure the course is ready for students. During/after the course runs, we make further adjustments based on instructor and student feedback.*

In a typical full course design, here are some things you might expect:

## FAQ for Course Developers

* **What are the advantages of having the content for a course go through the Design Process?
**
In your daily practice as a teacher of the subject, there are many ways to instruct your students. Creating content fidelity ensures that students from different cohorts receive the same quality of content, learning, and experiences. Designing a course allows you to be the expert on the subject and create the learning environment and plan the application from the beginning. This adds flexibility, quality, and coherence to the course.

* **What are the steps of the Design Process?
**
The key steps in developing an online course at TWU are: 1. Pre-planning, 2. Planning (completion of a Blueprint), 3. Writing, 4. Production and 5. Review.

* **Who owns the content I write?
**

* **How long does the Design Process usually takes?
**
There are many factors that affect the timeline of a course development, however we consider that in average, completing the Design Process can take between 6 to 10 months. 

* **What type of support will I get from the Online Learning Team?

## Thoughts by a Subject Matter Expert 

> The design process was very efficient and streamlined with relevant feedback from the design team at every stage. My experience working in the content using the blueprint and unit development guidance by the Instructional Designer was extremely positive with both Karen Roeck and Mara Chequer. Both provided excellent support and ideas in a format that allowed organization of content prior to the process with the blueprint, and walking alongside reviewing the content once completed. The benefits I believe will result from working in the content is that it will provide students with current course resources and materials that are continually updated by a Subject Matter Expert. By having courses go through this process, students will have a uniform Moodle experience regardless of the individual instructor or the course itself.  Navigating the course shell will follow the same pattern as their other courses and the consistency will positively impact the student learning experience.

## Glossary of Terms

**Subject Matter Expert (SME)** - Instructor who plans and writes the course material.

**Instructional Designer (ID)** - works with instructors to design online courses.

**Facilitator** - In some modalities, courses will have a facilitator to guide students in their learning at designated Learning Labs.  Note Facilitators are not subject matter experts, but are training in online learning facilitation (see [Graduate Certificate in Adult Learning: Coaching and Facilitation](https://www.twu.ca/leadership-ma/graduate-certificate-adult-learning-coaching-and-facilitation)).

**Synchronous** - It means that the instructor and the students are engaged in the same course content and each other at the same time, but may do so from different places. In order to hold live classes or meetings, instructors interact in real time through streaming audio, video, and presentations.

**Asynchronous** - Asynchronous learning in an online environment allows students to access information at their own pace and does not include a live lecture component, however, there could be a prerecorded component as part of the online learning experience.

**FAR Centre** -  The letters FAR stand for Facilitated Academic Resources.  FAR Centres are TWU micro-campuses located around the world where Global Education Specialists coach and facilitate learning for learners taking TWU courses toward TWU degrees. A FAR Centre is a collaboration between TWU and an institutional university or college partner.

**TWU Student Learning Outcomes** - All TWU courses have course learning outcomes that must align with the TWU [Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/academics/student-learning-outcomes).  Note some programs have additional outcomes, such as the [MA Leadership Competency Model](https://www.twu.ca/leadership-ma/competency-model).
