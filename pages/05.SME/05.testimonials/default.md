## Thoughts from our Subject Matter Experts

Our Online Team truly values the relationships we have with faculty at TWU.  We partner with them, not only to put their course online, but to guide them in best practices for teaching and learning.

Below are some Faculty testimonials on the Course Design Process at TWU.

> The design process was very efficient and streamlined with relevant feedback from the design team at every stage. My experience working in the content using the blueprint and unit development guidance by the Instructional Designer was extremely positive with both Karen Roeck and Mara Chequer. Both provided excellent support and ideas in a format that allowed organization of content prior to the process with the blueprint, and walking alongside reviewing the content once completed. The benefits I believe will result from working in the content is that it will provide students with current course resources and materials that are continually updated by a Subject Matter Expert. By having courses go through this process, students will have a uniform Moodle experience regardless of the individual instructor or the course itself.  Navigating the course shell will follow the same pattern as their other courses and the consistency will positively impact the student learning experience.

*Faculty Testimonial for Course Design Process*

> Like most professors, except for professors in the Education Department, I have
never taken any formal education courses, so my experience of the course design
process with the TWU instructional designers, most of whom are also certified
teachers, has been educational, constructive, and collaborative. I worked
specifically with Jessica David in developing WRTG 100, ENGL 103, and ENGL 102,
and I learnt a lot about intentionality, student learning, and assessment. I am
particularly grateful for having undergone this course design process for an
on-line environment because it has also made my courses in the physical
classroom better in structure, student engagement, and assessment. I have had
very positive experiences of the course design process because of the
instructional designers’ professionalism, open communication, and flexibility. I
have also found that coming into this development process with a willingness to
learn and to make changes even to courses that I have taught for many years
resulted in having greater peace of mind especially in an ever changing learning
environment where I could have confidence that the courses that have been
developed collaboratively would help me pivot and adjust to whatever learning
challenges may come my way in a world of uncertainty where the classroom could
be anywhere.

*Faculty Testimonial for Course Design Process*

######1.	What did you think of the course design process?
>Very timely and a much-needed process.  We need to think about how our audience/demographics/marketplace needs have changed and update our courses to the meet the market demands.

######2.	Please share your experience planning the course using a detailed blueprint, developing units with guidance from the Instructional Designer, receiving technical support, etc.
>Positive all the way.  I have now worked with 3 ID’s directly. They supported my every step and answered questions throughout the process as a SME.

######3.	What was surprising or challenging about the course design process?
>Keeping tight to the timelines, having to juggle all the other aspects of my job description. IT was very understanding and adjusted the timelines as needed.

######4.	What tips would you have for future course developers?
>Meet in person – it helps when there is a relationship between both parties.  It transforms the partnership from transactional to relational.  However, covid impacted this aspect but the zoom meetings still worked, and the job got done.

######5.	What benefits have you noticed from this course design process?
>Working together with the ID, creating group brilliance, utilizing the skills, and collaborating was truly a success!  The ID being able to listen to my ramblings and make sense of it, and put to paper in an easy to follow manner for the online audience.

*Faculty Testimonial for Course Design Process*

> I would like to express my appreciation to all the wisdom and energy that Kelly and Jessica put into the design process of WRTG 101 and ENGL101. As these two skill-based courses are foundational courses mostly for first-year international students who can be intimidated by new online learning environment, the course design itself needed more visual aids color-coded for learners’ better comprehension and the simplest learning lab activities that do not hinder formative learning process regardless of learners’ low digital literacy. Through the ongoing interaction with the instructional designers and with their collaborative endeavor, I was able to include these important elements of the courses effectively online. Moreover, developing a detailed blueprint (i.e. course scope and sequence) was a helpful process to doublecheck how course learning outcomes can be assessed online and what technological tools can be used appropriately for each learning activity from a holistic point of view.

*First Year Student Testimonial*

> I understand that both taking and giving online classes is a challenge, but Professor Hong and Ms. Sha (a facilitator) made this experience very interactive, friendly, and immersive. WRTG 101 and ENGL 101 were not only my first glimpse into TWU’s academic life, but also to the student life itself. Thus, having the support provided by them both and my writing tutors in the Writing center, has certainly been a nice transition into Trinity Western University…. I think all involved are making a great job at creating an accessible, interactive, and insightful online environment. So, thank you, once again. It was tough, but it was a true blessing.
