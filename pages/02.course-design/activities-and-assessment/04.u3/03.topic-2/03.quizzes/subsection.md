### Quizzes

Test, exams, quizzesâ€¦these are essential to many courses, however, there is definitely an art to designing an effective and fair test. An what about online tests?  How do we prevent students from cheating...or confirm the identity of the test-taker?  Several questions arise when designing tests for online courses.  First, let's pause and consider the use and effectiveness of formative, ungraded tests.

#### Formative Quizzes
In our online courses, we think about the assessments and whether students have enough guidance and practice.  For low-level memorization of key terms for example, you could create flashcards or quizzes (e.g. matching, fill-in-the blank, multiple choice, etc.).  Yes, it may take some time to create, but our online team can help you! Once we receive the terms and definitions from instructors we typically use [h5P](https://h5p.org/content-types-and-applications), an open source application that seamlessly integrates into Moodle (and other websites).

Here are some examples from our courses:

*Sample 1: [Flashcards](https://h5p.org/flashcards)*

[h5p id="29"]

*Sample 2: [Drag the Words](https://h5p.org/drag-the-words)*

[h5p id="55"]

*Sample 3: [Multiple Choice](https://h5p.org/multichoice)*

[h5p id="36"]


!! Note that H5P is an application in Moodle, so you can create your own quizzes and use it for graded assessments.

#### Graded Quizzes, Tests & Exams
For your graded assessments, there are some key questions to ask:
- What is the purpose of the assessment?
- Does it test the level of understanding that I need to assess?
- Are the instructions clear?
- What question types are effective to help students explain what they know (short answer, multiple choice, etc.)
- How easy will it be for students to look up the answers as they take the test?

We've provided some resources below that may help you address some of these questions.  Considering the last one in particular, you may want to take the following measures as you design your assessment:
- Set a time limit.  
- Have a question bank.  Moodle can select from a number of questions and randomize the quiz numbers for each student.
- Craft your questions to include more higher-order thinking skills - requiring more application, rather than retrieving facts from their textbook.
- Remember, your usual in-class test could now be considered a take home test.  Students will have all of their resources available to check.  Perhaps encourage them to use them! The time limit will help focus students.
- And lastly...consider what could be assessed in a different assignment format (e.g. video essay, journal response, case study report).
