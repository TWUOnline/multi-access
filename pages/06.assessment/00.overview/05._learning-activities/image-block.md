### Engage, Practice, Connect - Get Messy!
Learning activities are designed to help students engage with the course topics.  They allow students to get "messy" with their learning, to practice and test out ideas, and to connect with others about the course content. Learning is a process, and activities allow for students to work through questions, organize their learning, explore solutions, and prepare for assessments.   

Activities are often ungraded and optional in online courses, so why should students complete them?  One way to motivate students is to emphasize how the activities will help students succeed in their assessments. As you select learning activities for your course, be sure they relate to the course/unit learning outcomes and that they help prepare learners for their assessment.
