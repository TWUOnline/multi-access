#### Activity 3.3: Resources on Discussion Forums
:fa-book: Select from the following resources:

- [Generating and Facilitating Engaging and Effective Online Discussions](https://facultyinnovate.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/Effective-Online-Discussions.pdf)
- [Collaborative Online Learning: Fostering Effective Discussions](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/teaching-resources/teaching-tips/alternatives-lecturing/discussions/collaborative-online-learning)
- [Discussion Boards: Valuable? Overused? Discuss.](https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2019/03/27/new-approaches-discussion-boards-aim-dynamic-online-learning)


:fa-pencil: Consider now the differences between a Discussion Forum and a Blog.  What is the purpose?  What can learners do/share with either activity?  What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?

Create a T-chart, comparing the two.
