# Considerations for Educational Technology

​There is a plethora of tools available to engage students and help meet the learning outcomes of your course. Before deciding which tools to use, ask these questions:
- What are the learning outcomes of the activity/assignment?
- What access do students have?
- Will this tool be a barrier to learning? (e.g. more time spent on tech than learning).
- What support is available for students who use this tool?
 - Could students choose their own tool to demonstrate their learning?


In the tabs below are some links to help students and instructors **communicate, collaborate, share, engage and create.**
Also, be sure to check out the tools available through Moodle (e.g. [H5P](https://h5p.org/) is a great one!).

# Reflect & Share
How can educational technology be used to encourage and develop critical thinking skills?  The tools listed below require reflective thinking, selecting content to share, refining ideas, and responding to peers.
- [WordPress](http://create.twu.ca/help/wordpress): Consider having a blog or e-portfolio assignment in your course. Not only will learners develop digital skills, but this online platform allows students to share their learning experience and connect with peers. Note that blogs can be kept private and students should be made aware of privacy concerns.
  - See [TWU E-Portfolios](https://create.twu.ca/eportfolios/) for more information on setting up this assessment.
