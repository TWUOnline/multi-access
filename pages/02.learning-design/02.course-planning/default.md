## Planning Your Course
### Key Planning Questions

![alt-text](courseplanning.jpg "Hand Writing")

Designing a course is like planning to build a house. There are a lot of details to think through, and you start with asking some key questions, such as who is the house for, what features are required, what support is needed, what will make it feel like a home?, etc.

Similarly, for course design, we ask:

‚ùî Who is the **learner**?  What is the average age, work experience, culture, etc.? What are their interests, learning styles, and needs? Why are they taking the course?  
‚ùî Why is this course important?  What are the **big ideas**, or the main take-aways for learners?   
‚ùî What are the course **learning outcomes?** How will students demonstrate their understanding of these outcomes?  
‚ùî How will the course be **delivered**?  How will students connect with their peers, with the instructor, and with the content?  
‚ùî If a previous course exists, has there been any **feedback** from students and instructors?

Notice, we didn't start with these questions...

üìï What textbook should I use for the course?  
üìò What topics are covered in the textbook chapters?  
üìó What publisher resources are available (e.g. testbank, PowerPoint presentations)?  
üìô What topics will fit into my 16 weeks course?  


Instead, we use what's called **[Backward Design](https://multi-access.twu.ca/learning-design/backward-design)** to develop the course.

### Backward Design
**Backward Design** (Fink, 2003; Wiggins & McTighe, 2005) is a contrast to the traditional method of designing curriculum, which often starts with identifying the topics (or chapters in a textbook), and then maps out the weekly lessons according to those resources. With the backward approach, we focus first on the end results, which helps map out the course and leads to more productive activities and assessments.

![](Backward-Design.jpg)

**To plan your course, here are the 3 stages using Backward Design:**
1. We first focus on the *target*: what knowledge, skills or attitudes do we want students to have at the end of the course? Essentially, what are the course **learning outcomes**?
2. Second, how will learners *demonstrate* that they have the knowledge, skills or attitudes identified?  What **assessment** strategy will show students level of understanding of the course learning outcomes?
3. Finally, what learning *experiences* will help students achieve this?  What **activities** will scaffold students' learning, engage them in the topics, and allow them to practice or develop their understanding of the course learning outcomes?

&nbsp;

üì∫ Watch the following 5 minute video on Backward Design.

Note in the video how they emphasize the connections between the three key components of the course: **Outcomes**, **Assessment**, **Activities**.  Learning outcomes inform assessment and activity choice; activities are designed to prepare students for assessments to demonstrate understanding of the outcomes.

As you design your course outcomes, assessments, and learning activities, keep in mind what will motivate and inspire your students.

To continue with the next steps in course planning, see the [Blueprint Stage](https://multi-access.twu.ca/learning-design/blueprint)


## Creating a Course Blueprint
To help you plan your course, we develop a course blueprint that maps out key components of the course.
Feel free to use/copy the [TWU Course Blueprint Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EaxSXVEe8fwqXXRJITg-RCAdtD69Uaza7wSjwkXsQro/edit?usp=sharing) on Google docs.

Here are key steps in filling out a blueprint: (Click the title on the steps below)


[ui-accordion independent=false open=none]

[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 1: Big Ideas and Essential Questions"]

One strategy we use before getting into the details of a course is identifying the **Big Ideas** (Wiggins & McTighe, 2005). Below is an image from Stanford University (adapted) that takes us through the process of deciding the big ideas, essential questions, key knowledge and skills, and learning activities.

![alt-text](big-ideas-los.png "Big ideas template")

The first part of the blueprint asks you to identify 1-2 ideas and a few essential questions
that will serve as the narrative frame or the ‚Äúhook‚Äù for your course. You might
think of a big idea as a subtitle or unifying theme for your course. In an inquiry-based approach to learning, what are some **essential questions** learners may ask throughout the course?

![alt-text](twu-bp-ideas.png "Big Ideas section in Blueprint")

!!! As you consider your big ideas and essential questions, it might help to talk to your colleagues! Some departments suggest a literature review before you start the design process, so you can address these ideas and questions based on current research.

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 2: Course Description"]

Next, we have a look at the course description.  Does the description cover the big ideas or themes of your course?  Does it address or align with the course learning outcomes (we'll address these in the next section)?  Does it have unnecessary information that may change with various versions of the course (e.g. class activities that may not apply to online cohorts, assignments or resources that may change, etc.)?

Consider your course description as a hook to get students interested in your course. It should summarize what they will learn, and should imply why it matters, or how they will apply this learning experience.

!! Note that if there are any changes to a course description, these need to be approved by Senate.  

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 3: Course Learning Outcomes"]

Third, we identify the learning outcomes we want students to achieve. Learning outcomes describe what learners will be able to *know, do and value* after a learning experience. They clearly explain the knowledge, skills, and attitudes students will gain through a course.

It is crucial to have measurable learning outcomes listed on the course outline, as they communicate expectations to the learner and help guide the instructor.  

Note that for each course learning outcome, we need to identify the [TWU Student Learning Outcome](https://www.twu.ca/academics/student-learning-outcomes) it aligns with.  In this part of the blueprint we ask you to categorize your learning outcomes, and begin to think of possible learning artifacts, or evidence of learning.

## Writing Effective Learning Outcomes

![](SMART-goals.png)

The diagram above illustrates the five key principles in designing learning outcomes.  They must be specific and clear, instructors must be able to measure successful completion of an outcome, and learners must be able to achieve them.  Learning outcomes should also be relevant to the course and achievable within the time period allotted.

! By the end of the course, students will be able to...

The verb that follows in this sentence is crucial.  It identifies not only what students will **do** to show their understanding of the outcome (e.g. analyze, compare, create, etc.), but to **what level** of understanding they will have if they are successful in the assessment.  To help select the appropriate verb, here are some key resources we use in writing learning outcomes:

### Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy
We often use Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy to help write learning outcomes. The graphics below lists possible verbs to use in a learning outcome, as well as examples of activities and/or assessments.  Just to give one example, if you are assessing the domain of analysis by asking student to compare, you may ask them to create and administer a survey.  As you write your outcomes, what **[Higher Order Thinking Skills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_thinking) (HOTS)** are you promoting?

See the following images that suggest key verbs related to learning activities.

For more, see [Revised Bloom‚Äôs Taxonomy](https://www.celt.iastate.edu/teaching/effective-teaching-practices/revised-blooms-taxonomy/) from Iowa State University.


### Significant Learning
Fink (2003) described learning as change in the learner.  How can we tell what has changed in our students, or how the course has impacted them?
In his book, *Creating Significant Learning Experiences: An Integrated Approach to Designing Colleges Courses*, he asks instructors to consider what students will take away from the course.  What are the long-term goals?  What will they remember?

The image here shows Fink‚Äôs Taxonomy of Significant Learning.  Consider the various categories of learning as you write your outcomes.  Will students apply their learning?  Learn about themselves or others?  Value a new idea or perspective? Become a self-directed learner?

Dahl</a> shared under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">Creative Commons (BY-NC) license</a> </small>


### SOLO Taxonomy
Another great resource that can help you write effective learning outcomes is the *Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO)* created by John Biggs and K. Colis. The images below show the 5 levels of understanding.  As you write your outcomes, consider the increasing complexity of understanding students can demonstrate through assessments.  How will they know what level they are at?  Try to incorporate descriptions in a grading rubric that explain the connections you want students to make (e.g. analyze, compare, hypothesize, predict, etc.)

[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 4: Course Assessment"]
Once we know where students are going (learning outcomes), we need to know how students will show that they've met the learning outcomes. There should be a clear link between what we ask students to do in the assignment, and what is stated in the related learning outcome.

### Alternative Forms of Assessment  
A summative assessment does not have to be an exam, but can instead be a
portfolio, website, video, conversation, research paper, presentation,
case study, plan, or project.  These often allow students to demonstrate prior learning and allow for more authentic assessment - that is personalized tasks that relate to their profession.

This section in the blueprint asks instructors to connect assessment to the course learning outcomes that are demonstrated.

![alt-text](twu-bp-assessment.png "Assessment section in Blueprint")

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 5: Unit Planning"]

Perhaps the most time-consuming part of the blueprint is the unit plan.  In this section, we determine the sequence of the course by aligning each outcome and its
associated formative and/or summative activities with a particular unit in your
course. Many instructors divide their course into weekly units, but it's important to have more of a topical structure. This allows for more flexibility for condensed courses, and helps to focus specific topics to their related unit learning outcomes.

!!!! *A note about Learning Activities*: Once you know what learners will do and how well they will do it, consider the formative learning activities which will **scaffold** the learners' progress towards the proficiency targets for each outcome. Upon completion of a formative learning activity, learners should know how they performed relative to the priority course outcome and specifically how they can close the gap between their actual performance and the expected performance. Faculty, likewise, should know what each learner needs to do to close the gap and they should also know how to differentiate future learning activities in order to address misconceptions.

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="STEP 6: Resources"]

A final section of the blueprint is dedicated to a resource list.  As a blueprint is simply a planning document - one that can and will change as you develop the course - feel free to add resources you are thinking of using.

Our online team often encourages instructors to consider Open Educational Resources (OERs). If you're interested in exploring OERs and other course resources, please see the [Resources](https://multi-access.twu.ca/learning-design/resources) section.
