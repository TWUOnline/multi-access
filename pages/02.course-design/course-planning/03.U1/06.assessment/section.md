## Assessment
Seeing as this course is learner-directed and ungraded - this section is what you make of it!
We would love for you to participate in the Discussion forums and we build our Community of Inquiry and support each other in our online adventures.

For this first unit, please see the Discussion Forum in Unit 1 in Moodle.  Later on, we may post discussions in our open [TONE website](http://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/april-2020/overview), but in case you haven't tackled discussion forums in Moodle (like your students have to!) then please head on over to the [TONE Moodle site](https://learn.twu.ca/course/view.php?id=13628&section=1) and give it a try!


### Unit 1 Discussion: Introductions & Questions
Feel free to answer one or all of the following:
1. Please introduce yourself! What do you teach, how long have you taught at TWU, what are your interests, what have you learned during this time of self-isolation, etc.? Feel free to share a picture of someone or something that means a lot to you (i.e. your pet, family, favourite movie or book, etc.).
2. What questions do you have about online learning and teaching?  What are you most concerned about or interested in as you move your course online?
3. What is your Philosophy of Online Learning?
4. What have you learned from the sessions this week? (e.g. synchronous group session, Learning Pod session, Tech Talk)

!!! To write your discussion post, see the Discussions tab in Moodle and click on the Unit 1 Discussion Forum.
