## Instructor's Guide for TWU Online

Whether you are new to teaching an online course at TWU, or you have taught online for 20 years, we hope this guide will provide support as you structure your content, plan for connections, and facilitate a welcome and inclusive learning experience for your learners.

### Structure

Intuitive course navigation and clear instructions are important in your online course design.  Below is a suggested way to organize your material in Moodle (or WordPress). 

[ui-accordion independent=false open=none]

[ui-accordion-item title="1. Course Overview"]
The Course Introduction page provides an overview of the course, including the **syllabus**, how to navigate the course, and tips for students for learning online.  

!!! Consider adding a personal welcome message or video from the instructor to connect with learners and welcome them into the course.  

[/ui-accordion-item]

[ui-accordion-item title="2. Schedule"]

Although you may have a detailed schedule in your syllabus, you may want to set up a page that details key information for each week, including:  
- key resources students need to read/watch;  
- important ungraded learning activities that will help them complete an assignment;
- information on which activities to complete before/after a class session.

[/ui-accordion-item]
[ui-accordion-item title="3. Course Notes"]

Online course vary in how they organize instructional materials.  This may be weekly, in one complete Course Book, separate Unit Books in Moodle, etc.  The key is that the navigation is intuitive, and students know where to access the information they need.

!!! In your first class, please take some time to show students how to navigate the course materials.
[/ui-accordion-item]
[ui-accordion-item title="4. Assessment"]

If you have several weeks or units in your course, you (& your students!) may find it helpful to have all assignment instructions and dropboxes in one section. As you review your assessment instructions, please check the following:

- Please ensure that the assignments have the detailed instructions, including grading criteria you will use to assess the quality of the work.
- Add the due dates in the Assignment Dropbox settings.
- Check that the Gradebook is set up correctly.  Please see the Online Learning article on [Gradebook](https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1904/Portal/KB/?CategoryID=22747) for instructions.

[ui-accordion-item title="5. Community"]

How is Community promoted in TWU Online courses?  The Community tab is a section where you can keep announcements, ungraded discussion forums, and FAQ.  Please make this section work for you and your students!  The idea is to promote inclusion, connections between peers, and communication with the instructor.

You may want to find out what tools your students prefer to communicate with each other (Discord, Slack, Teams, etc.).  Please share your communication preferences, office hours, and other tips for succeeding in your course.

### Connection
Now that you have your basic structure set up for your online course, how do you design a quality online learning experience for your students?  Key to successful online learning is a connection - between learners, between the instructor and learners, and between the learner and the content.  See the graphic below as well as the [Community of Inquiry](https://coi.athabascau.ca/coi-model/) website for more details.

## Instructor To-Do List For New Course Sections

There are a few things you should do before the semester starts to ensure that your students have a smooth transition to studying with you.  
[ui-accordion independent=false open=none]

[ui-accordion-item title="To-Do List"]

✔️ Receive confirmation of course code and Moodle access info.

✔️ Import content from your previous cohort. If yours is a new course, the Online team can add you to the Master course shell so you can import from there to your new section. If importing from a previous course, delete items that you no longer need. See here for instructions.

✔️ Add a syllabus: You will need to change the dates in the syllabus, make sure it is a pdf version, get approval from the department chair, and upload it to Moodle on the Course Introduction tab.

✔️ Add a welcome message: Add an Announcement forum at the bottom of the Course Introduction page. to welcome your new students, tell them about yourself and how to reach you (e.g. email), and perhaps share an encouraging Bible verse or what interests you about this course. If you feel up to it, add a video welcome message!

✔️ Check the course materials: You may notice that this fully developed online course has a lot of material, including videos, unit writing, and external links. If possible, please check for broken links and send a message to our online team (elearning@twu.ca) so we can help you fix any errors.

✔️ Check the Assignment details and due dates: Due dates should be found in your course syllabus, but they may also be in your Discussion Forums and/or Assignment dropboxes. Please check that those dates are correct. Also add or edit the Assignment dropboxes (if they are missing). Confirm assessment details, such as due dates (can be added to the title of dropboxes if desired).

✔️ Check the Gradebook: Please double check that all assessment material is correct, including the percentages in the course Gradebook.

✔️ Prepare for Synchronous sessions: If you have synchronous Zoom Meetings in your course, you will need to become familiar with the following:

Scheduling class meetings
Recording Zoom Meetings
Adding the recorded session to Microsoft Stream
Embedding videos into Moodle See the following guide for details: Managing Videos | TWU Learning Environment Help Pages
✔️ Use Announcements for Weekly encouragement and review.

✔️ Course Visibility: Your course is visible to you as the instructor, but it is hidden from students. When you are ready, follow these instructions to make your course visible to students. Your course will move from the 'Future' tab on your dashboard to the 'In progress' tab on the date indicated in the 'Start date' field of the course settings.

[ui-accordion-item title="Git Support (aka - "I can't seem to edit my course content!")"]

For some OL courses, you may have noticed that parts of your course are difficult to edit. This is because we use a different program (Git) to display your course content in Moodle. This allows for version control and course fidelity across your program.

Our TWU Online team can help you with any changes you want to make to the course materials.  Please email elearning@twu.ca or click on the following link to [Send a Bug report](https://github.com/TWUOnline/bug-tracking/issues/new?assignees=cmadland%2C+kmarjanovic%2C+MeeksonHundoo&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=) to our team.
