### Learning Activities: Preparing for Assessments
One other alignment check that needs to be made in your course design is the connection between the assessments and the learning activities.  Learning activities are designed to help students engage with the course topics.  They are often ungraded and optional, so in order to motivate students to complete them, we need to emphasize the connections to the assignments and how the activities will help students succeed in their assessments.

Another reason to include learning activities in your online course is so that learners can practice the key concepts/questions and get *messy* with their learning.  Learning is a process, and activities allow for students to work through questions, organize their learning, explore solutions, and prepare for assessments.
