# Online Teaching and Learning
## Trinity Western University

[ui-tab title=Online Learning at TWU"]

At Trinity Western University, we strive to "prepare students to deal with complexity, diversity, and change by providing them with a broad knowledge of the wider world and help them to develop transferable intellectual and practical skills" (from [Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/academics/student-learning-outcomes)). In an Online learning environment, how do we do this?

To ensure you have all the tools to guide your students in their learning, the TWU Online Learning Team is here to support you!  On this website, we share resources for designing accessible, engaging, high quality online courses.  We hold professional development workshops, "Teaching Online Effectively (TOne)" throughout the year, as well as individual consultations and support services.

Whether you have a in person class, a flipped model, multi-access course, etc., feel free to browse this site and reach out to our team if you have any questions. (Email: online@twu.ca)

[ui-tab title="Teaching ONline Effectively (TOnE)"]

We have developed a mini-course called Teaching ONline Effectively (TOnE) to help you think about and design the scenarios that we will be attending to in the Fall semester.

The course is designed intentionally to develop and nurture a Community of Reflection and Practice (CORP) and connect you with colleagues (inside and outside your department) who are working on many of the same issues as you will be. This structure of learning pods is a high impact teaching practice that we hope you will implement in your own courses.

[You are encouraged to view the course materials online](http://multi-access.twu.ca/tone/), as they provide helpful links on course design, assessments, and digital tools, as well as providing an example of a developed online course.
