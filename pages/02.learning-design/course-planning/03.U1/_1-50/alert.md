#### Activity 1.7: Methods of Teaching (Online & F2F)

Now that we've had a very quick overview of some key design principles, how does this relate to online and face-to-face classrooms?

:fa-book: Read [Chapter 3: Methods of teaching: campus-focused](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/part/chapter-4-methods-of-teaching/) and [Chapter 4: Methods of teaching with an online focus](https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/teachinginadigitalagev2/part/chapter-6-models-for-designing-teaching-and-learning/).  

Create a T-chart, comparing the campus class to the online class.  

| *Campus Class* | *Online Class* |
|----------------|----------------|
| -               | -               |
| -               | -               |

*Questions to Consider*

:fa-question: Is there overlap between the modalities?  
:fa-question: Could you anticipate any problems with trying to use classroom models of teaching in online environments?
