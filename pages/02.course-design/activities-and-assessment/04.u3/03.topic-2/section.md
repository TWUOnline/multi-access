## Topic 2: Activity & Assessment Ideas

This topic is all about exploration and sharing.  We'll present a number of engaging learning activities with a range of purposes:
- First and foremost, the learning activity must align with your course/unit learning outcomes.
- Activities should also connect to assessments, allowing learners to practice and prepare for assignments.
- In addition to your listed learning outcomes, there may be other skills the activities promote, including: collaboration, critical and creative thinking, quantitative and qualitative reasoning, communication, research, and information literacy. (See TWU's [Student Learning Outcomes](https://www.twu.ca/academics/student-learning-outcomes).)

As you explore the ideas and the links provided in this unit, you are encouraged to add your comments, ideas, experiences to our **shared chalkboard** (see chart below or click [here](https://padlet.com/kelly_marjanovic/mtxqc9gvjy5z0zp5) for Padlet).
Please let us know what activities/assignments have worked well in your class, or which you would like to try.  Perhaps share a link to a google doc of assignment instructions, or add a picture/screenshot of the activity.  This is our opportunity to develop our **Community of Practice** - to share resources, experiences, and encouragement.

In the next several pages, we're going to explore some common activity/assessment types in online courses.

  - **Please note** that not all of these activity and assessment types will work for your course!  Focus on what will help students practice and achieve the learning outcomes.

Now, let's dive into our idea smorgasbord!
