## High Impact Practices

So how *should* we teach online?  What techniques make a difference for learners in terms of their success and overall experience in the course?

The Association of American Colleges and Universities (report on [High-Impact Educational Practices](https://carleton.ca/viceprovost/wp-content/uploads/kuh_2008_brief_overview.pdf); Kuh, 2008) has identified 10 activities or program components that have been shown to have high-impact on students.

Eleven practices have been identified as high impact practices:
1. First-Year Experiences
1. Common Intellectual Experiences
1. Learning Communities
1. Writing-Intensive Courses
1. Collaborative Assignments and Projects
1. Undergraduate Research
1. Diversity/Global Learning
1. Service Learning, Community-Based Learning
1. Internships
1. Capstone Courses and Projects
1. ePortfolios

So how does this translate to online teaching techniques?  In [Five High-Impact Teaching Practices](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1104478.pdf), L. Dee Fink discusses how these primarily institutional or curricular HIPs are can relate to a parallel set of high-impact teaching practices (HITPs)?  

Here are the key engagement strategies Fink suggests:

1. Helping students become meta-learners
2. Learning-centered course design
3. Using small groups in a powerful way
4. Service-learning/community engagement—with reflection
5. Being a leader with your students

The University of Waterloo suggests similar themes in [High Impact Practices (HIPs) or Engaged Learning Practices](https://uwaterloo.ca/centre-for-teaching-excellence/support/integrative-learning/high-impact-practices-hips-or-engaged-learning-practices):

1. Set performance expectations at  appropriately high levels, and effectively communicate these expectations to students
1. Encourage students to invest significant and meaningful  time and effort on authentic, complex tasks over an extended period of time
1. Add meaningful interactions amongst students and between  faculty and students about  substantive matters
1. Challenge students’ ways of thinking, increase interactions with individuals with experiences and life experiences different from their own,  Experiences with diversity
1. Provide frequent, timely and constructive feedback
1. Increase periodic, structured opportunities to reflect and integrate learning
1. Provide opportunities to discover relevance of learning through real-world applications, or add a real-world/authentic experience
1. Add a public demonstration of competence
